second edition.'’—Saturday Review.

CICE6RdO. PRO SULLA. Edited by J. S. REID, Litt.D.
3s. .

‘⁶ Mr Reid is so well known to scholars as a commentator on Cicero that a new work from him
scarcely needs any commendation of ours. His edition os the speech Pro Sulla is sully equal in
merit to the volumes which he has already published . . . It would be difficult to speak too highly
of the notes. There could be no better way os gaining an insight into the characteristics of
Cicero's style and the Latinity of his period than by making a caresul study of this speech with
the aid os Mr Reid's commentary . . . Μι- Reid’s intimate knowledge of the minutest details of
scholarship enables him to detect and explain the slightest points of distinction between the
usages of different authors and diflerent periods . . . The notes are followed by a valuable
appendix on the text, and another on points of orthography; an excellent index brings the work
to a close.'’—Saturday Revz'ew.
