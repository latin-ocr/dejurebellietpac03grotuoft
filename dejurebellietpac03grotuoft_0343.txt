num enim est credere id actum, ut belli semina evellerentur.
Idem quem modo laudavi Dionysius Halicarnassensis: οῠκ
ἀπόχρη τοῦτο μόνον ἡμᾶς σκοπεῖν ὅπως ἂν τήν παροῦσαν
ἔχθραν διαλυσαίμεθα πρὸς ἀλλήλους, ἀλλ’ ὥστε μηδ’ αὖθίς
’ῙΓΟΤΕ πολεμήσᾱῌλΕΙ] ’έΤι δεῖ παρασκευάσασθαι· Οὐ ’γὰρ ἁμα·-
[Rome ποιησόμενοι ’τῶν κακῶν συνεληλύθαμεν, ἀλλ’ ἀπαλ-
λαγάς-ε non tam coyz'tandum est de sarcienda ‘ln praesens
amicitia, quam id curandum ne bello iterum implicemur:
neque enim ad clzjffcrenda sed ad auferenda mala conveni-
mus: quae postrema verbo tenus ferme desumta sunt ex
Isocrate, oratione cle Pace.

XX. Quae post perfectas pactiones capta sunt, reddenda
satis constat, sublatum enim jam erat belli jus.

XXI. At in pactionibus, quae sunt de reddendis hiS, quae
bello capta sunt, primum latius interpretandae quae mutuae
sunt quam quae claudicant: deinde quae de hominibus agunt
plus favoris habent quam quae de rebus: et inter eas‘quae de
rebus, hae quae de agris plus quam quoe de rebus mobilibus:
et quae de his quae penes publicum sunt plus quam quae penes
privatos: et inter eas quae penes privatos, plus illae quae reddi
jubent lucrativo titulo possessa, quam oneroso, ut quae emtio-
nibus, quae dotibus tenentur.

place, if there be any wordS‚ or fair conjecture, to eountenance the
suppositions: and this especially, if the right in question be not clear,
but controverted. For it is gracious to suppose that to have been
done, which plucks up the seeds of war. So Dionysius Halicarnassus,
whose concluding words are nearly taken from Isocrates in his oration
on the Peace.

XX. What is taken after the treaty is made, is to be restored3
for the right of war was previously extinguished.

XXI. In agreements concerning the restitution of capturos made
in war, in the first place, those articles are to be interpreted more
widely, which are mutual, than those which are one-sided3 in the
next place, those which treat concerning men are to be taken more
favourably than those concerning things ; and amongst those concern..
ing things, those eoneerning lzmds, more favourably than those eon-
eerning moveables3 and those eoncerning things in public possession,
more favourably than those which are in private3 and among those
which are in private possession, those which direct the restitution of
things possessed by a lucrative title, more favourably than by an
onerous title; and those which have been acquired by purchase, more
favourably than those by donation.
