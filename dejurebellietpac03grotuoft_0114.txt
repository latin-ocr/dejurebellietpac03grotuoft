101³ DE REBUS VASTANDIS ERIPIENDISQUE. [111ss. 111.

hostium reliyiosa nobis ozon sunt, ideoque lapides inde sub-
latos in quemlibet usum convertere possumus .· quod ita tamen
intelligendum, ne ipsa mortuorum corpora male tractentur,
quia id contra jus est hominum sepeliendorum, quod jure gen-
tium introductum alibi demonstravimus.

IV. Illud hic breviter repetam, non vi sola res hostium
hostibus eripi ex jure gentium, sed et dolos qui perfidia
careant permissos censeri, imo et alienae perfidiae incitationem.
Nimirum ad minora et frequentia haec delicta ita connivere
eoepit jus gentium, sicut leges civiles ad meretricium et im-
proba fenora.

 

Which however is to be understood in such a way that the bodies of
the dead are not to be ill-treated3 for that is against the rights of
burial, which is part of the Law of Nations, as wc have elsewhere
shewn.

IV. I will briefly again notice that by the Law of Nations‚ our
property may not only be rescued from the cnemy’s hands by
force, but also that dcceit which involves no perfidy is allowed, and
even the procurement of perfidy in others. In fact the Law of
Nations has begun to connive at those smaller and frequent offenses,
as the Civil Laws connive at prostitution and usury.
