318 DE FIDE INTER HOSTES. [Lm. ΙΙΙ.

quod promissum est opponi lite manente non poterit, aut actio
de qua lis erat, aut litis damnae et impensae, ita nec manente
bello compensari poterit aut id unde ortum est bellum, aut
quidquid bellico gentium jure fieri solet. N egotii enim natura,
ne nihil actum sit, ostendit convenisse sepositis belli contro-
versiis: nam alioqui nulla esset pactio quae non posset eludi:
nec forte male hue aptem quod tapud eundem, quem jam lau-
davi aliquoties, Senecam est: Nullam excusationem recepe-
runt (majores) ut homines scirent ficlem utique praestandam.
Satius enim erat α paucis etiam justam excasationem non
accipi, quam ab omnibus aliquam tentari.

2 Quze ergo sunt quae compensari cum eo quod promis-
sum est poterunt? nimirum si quid alter, quamvis ex alio
contractu, inter bellum inito, debet: si damnum dedit intra
induciarum tempora: si legatos violavit, aut aliud quid fecit
quod inter hostes jus gentium damnat.

3 Observandum tamen ut inter easdem personas fiat
compensatio, ac ne jus tertii cujusquam laedatur: ita tamen ut

between the two parties to a lawsuit, they cannot, during the suit, set
against what was promised, either the original ground of action, or
the loss and expense of the suit3 so while the war goes on, we cannot
bring into the balance, either the original ground of the war, or any-
thing which has resulted from the exercise of the usual belligerent
rights. For the nature of the business shews that the convention, in
order that it may not be without any effect, must have been made
setting aside the controversies belonging to the war itself. For other-
wise there could be no convention which might not be eluded. To
this we may apply a passage of Seneca: [which however is not very
closely to the purpose. W.]

2 What then are the matters, which may be balanced against that
which was promised? This for instance3 if the other, though from
another contract, made during the war, owes us a debt3 or if he have
committed damage during a time of truce; or if he have violated the
rights of ambassadors 3 or done anything else which the Law of Na·-
tions condemns as between enemies.

3 But it is to be observed, that compensation must take place
between the same persons who are so bound to each other, and so
that the right of a third party be not injured 3 but still, so that the
goods of subjects are understood to be bound for what the state owes,
as we have elsewhere said.

4 We must add this als03 that it is the part of a generous mind
