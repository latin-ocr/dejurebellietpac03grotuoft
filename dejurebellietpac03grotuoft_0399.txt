CAP. XXII] IN BELLO. 389

pares non obligant, quod Fabii et Marcelli historia apud Lib. xxiv. 19.
Livium declarat.
IX. 1 Homines, imperia, agros, bello quaesita concedere
itidem ducum non est. Hoc jure Syria Tigrani ademta, Just, x1-2-
quamquam Lucullus dederat. De Sophonisba, quae bello capta Liv- xxx· 14·
erat, ait Scipio, Senatus populique Romani judicium atque
arbitrium esse ; ideo a Masinissa, quo duce capta erat, liber-
tatem ei dari non potuisse. In res alias, quac in praeda sunt, east-armet,
jus aliquod concedi imperantibus videmus, non tam ex vi potes- ΜΗ ΜΗ
tatis, quam cujusque populi moribus: qua de re satis superius
a nobis dictum est. ξῑιῐᾎῑῑῑ- 6-
2 At nondum quaesita condonare omnino in ducum est'
potestate: quia oppida pleraque et homines saepe in bello de-
dunt se sub conditionibus vitae salvae, aut et libertatis, aut et
bonorum, de quibus summae potestatis arbitrium exquiri res
plerumque non patitur. Pari ratione jus hoc et ducibus non
summis dandum est intra ea, quae ipsis agenda commissa sunt.
Maharbal Romanis quibusdam, qui ex praelio ad Trasimenum
evaserant, satis longe absente Annibale, fidem dederat non

tantum vitae, τῆς σωτηρίας, ut nimium concise narrat Poly-

 

of equal authority3 as the history of Fabius and Marcellus in Livy
declares.

IX. 1 In the same way, it is not the business of generals to give up
men, conquests, lands, obtained in war. By this rule, Syria was taken
from Tigranes, though Lucullus had given it to him. Of Sophonisba,
who had been taken prisoner in war, Scipio says that the judgment
and decision of the Senate and People of Rome was to determine 3 and
that therefore Masinissa, though the general by whom she was taken,
could not give her liberty. That over other things which are taken
as prize of war, a certain disposal is conceded to persons in authority,
we have seen3 not so much from the force of their power, as from the
customs of each pccple: on which subject we have already spoken
sufficiently.

2 It is however in the power of generals to grant the possession
of things not yet acquired: because towns sometimes and men often
surrender themselves in war, on condition of lives being· spared, or
liberty, or property 3 among which concessions generally, the state of
things does not allow the decision of the supreme authority to be
asked. And by parity of reason, this right is also given to commandens
who are not the highest, within the limits of the matters which are
committed to them to execute. Maharbal had given to some Romans
who had escaped from the battle at Trasimenum, Annibal being absent
