imminet, citra culpae alienae considerationem invadere possum : Slssfliitssb-ffl'et
non tamen dominus fieri (id enim ad eum finem accommodatum

quod ipsum quoque tractatum est a nobis alibi. Sic rem Lib-itu.

III. Sciendum secundo est: jus nostrum non ex solo
belli principio spectandum, sed et ex causis subnascentibus,

sicut et in judiciis post litem contestatam jus saepe parti novum

another thing of the same value: and the like I may do for the sake
of recovering a debt: and in this case my ownership also is conse-
quent, because the equality which has been disturbed cannot be re-
stored in any other way.

3 So also when punishment is just, all force is just without
which punishment cannot be attained: and every thing which is part
of the punishment, as the destruction of property by burning or
otherwise3 that is, within just limits, corresponding to the offense.

ΙΙΙ. It is to be noted in the second place, that these rights are
not only to be regarded with reference to the origin of the war, but
also with reference to causes subnascent, that is, growing up during
