CAP.X1X.] DE FIDE INTER HOSTES. 309

VI. Quid dicemus de subditorum bellis adversus reges
aliasque summas potestates? his, etiamsi causam per se non
injustam habeant, jus tamen per vim agendi deesse ostendimus
alibi, Potest interdum et tanta esse aut causae injustitia, aut Lib. i. 4.
resistendi improbitas, ut puniri graviter possit. Tamen si
quasi cum desertoribus aut rebellibus actum sit, poena pro-
misso opponi non potest, secundum ea quae modo diximus.

Nam et seivis fidem servandam veterum pietas existimavit,

credito Lacedaemonios iram divinam expertos, quod Taenaren- ᾖῐιξῐζιῐξν-
ses servos contra pacta occidissent. Et Diodorus Siculus no- Lm ³11·ssss
tat fidem servis datam in fano Palicorum nunquam a quo-

quam domino fuisse violatam. Metus autem illati exceptio et

hio poterit elidi interposito jurejurando, sicut g M. Pomponius
tribunus plebis jurejurando obstrictus servavit, quod L. Manlio

metu coactus promiserat.

VII. Sed hic supra priores specialem difficultatem facit
jus legis constituendae et jus supereminens dominii in res sub-

ditorum quod civitati competit, et ejus nomine a summam po-

Juravit tribunus, nec fefellit, et causam dinem rediqere. Seneca de Beneficiis
accusationis remissoe concioni reddidit. 111. c. 37.
Nulli aliz· licuit impune tribunum in or-

 

other nations 3 inasmuch aS, on account of the hatred borne to robbers,
nations have agreed to overlook what is done against them, even by
vicious acts.

VI. What shall we say of the wars of subjects against kings and
other supreme authorities? That these, even when they have a cause
in itself not unjust, still have not the right of acting by force, we have
shewn elsewhere. But sometimes, in such cases, the injustice of the
cause, or the wickedness of the resistance, may be so great, that it may
be liable to heavy punishment. And yet if a treaty be conducted with
persons, as with deserters or robbers, such liability cannot be opposed
to the promise, as we have just said. Even to slaves, saith must be
kept, according to the piety of the ancients3 and it was believed that
the Lacedaemonians were visited by the divine anger, because, con-
trary to convention, they had put to death the Taenarians, who were
slaves. And it is noted by Diodorus, that saith pledged to a slave in
the temple of the Palici was never violated by a master. And the
exception of sear imposed, may here also be cancelled by interposing
an oath3 as M. Pomponius, tribune of the people, under the obligation
of an oath, kept the promise which L. Manlius had made under sear.

VII. But beyond these difficulties a special difficulty arises from
the right which the State possesses to make laws, and from its right of
