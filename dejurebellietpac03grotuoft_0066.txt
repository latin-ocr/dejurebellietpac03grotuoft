2 But in morals, the principal part is taken as the characteristi03
so Cicero and Galen. Wherefore Cicero spoke too widely, when he
said (in the third book of the Republic) that when the king is unjust,
or tho aristocracy, or the people itself, the commonwealth is not so
much to be called vicious as non-existing: which opinion, Augustino
correcting‚ says, We ure 7101 to says that tlte people does not eoeist, or that

a state, though grievously 0111 of health, is a state, as long as there

Law of Nations,) exists in a state, as the 50111 111 the body3 and that
when that is taken away, the state no longer exists. And Aristides, in
