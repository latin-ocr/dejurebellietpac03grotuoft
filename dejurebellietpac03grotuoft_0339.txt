CAP. XX] UBI DE PACIS PAOTIONE, ETO. 329

ideo ea sumenda est in pactis interpretatio, quae partes quoad
belli justitiam quam maxime aequet: quod fieri solet duobus
maxime modis: aut gut quarum rerum turbata bello possessio
est, ex formula juris antiqui componatur: (quae verba sunt
Menippi in oratione qua de federum generibus disserit) aut ut 5L7¹v xxxiv.
res maneant quo sunt loco: quod Graeci dicunt ἔχοντες ἃ ”
ἔχουσι·

XII. 1 Ex his duobus posterius in dubio magis est ut
praesumatur‚ quia facilius est, et nullam inducit mutationem.
Hinc est illud quod a Tryphonino notatum est, ut in pace illis ssffi'j‘gffl

2 But since parties will hardly come to peace by one side confess-·
ing to being in the wrong, therefore that interpretation is to be taken
which puts the parties, as much as possible, on an equality with
respect to the justice of the war. And this is done mainly in two
ways3 either that the possession which has been disturbed by war
should be restored, as expressed by the formula in statu quo ante
bellum ; or that matters remain as they are, which is expressed by uti
possidetis.

XII. 1 Of these two rubea, the latter is, in a doubtful case, to
be preferred, as being the easier, and inducing no change. Hence
the rule of Tryphoninus; that in peace, those prisoners only shall
have postliminium for whom such a compact was made3 which, as we
have shewn above, is the true reading. And thus, deserters are not to
be given up, except this be agreed upon; for we receive deserters by
the laws of war: that is, by the laws of war it is lawful for us to admit
and enrol in our numbers him who changes his side. Other things,
on such agreement, romain with the person who is in possession.

2 But this possession is taken not according to Oivil but to Natural
Law3 for in war, the fact of possession sufficcs, and nothing else is
attended to. And we speak of lands, as in possession, if they are pro·
