332 DE FIDE PUBLICA QUA BELLUM FINITUR, [L113.III.

nus inter ipsos reges aut populos versatur, remissum ideo cen-
seri debet, ne pax non satis pax sit, si veteres ad bellum
causas relinquat. Quare et ignorata hic venient sub verbis
generalibus, ut de mercatoribus Romanis quos a Carthaginien-
sibus mersos ignorabant Romani, narrante Appiano. κράτισ-
ται διαλλαγαὶ ἐν αἶς οὐδέν ἐστιν ἔγκοτον οὐδὲ μνησίκακον,
inquit Dionysius Halicarnassensis: optimae conciliatione-5 quae
iram et offensarum memoriam delent. Isocrates Plataica:
εἰρήνης οὔσης οὗ προσῆκε μνησικακεῖν περὶ τῶν τότε ’γε-
νομένων· in pace ozon decet ante peccata exequi.

XVIII. De privatorum jure ad poenam non tanta est
ratio ut remissum censeatur: quia sine bello judiciis expediri
potest: tamen cum hoc jus non ita nostrum sit ut quod ex in-
aequalitate nascitur, et poenae semper aliquid odii habeant,
levis verborum conjectura sufficiet, ut hoc quoque donatum
intelligatur.

XIX. Quod vero diximus, jus quod ante bellum fuit adem-
tum facile censeri non debere, id in privatorum jure firme
tenendum est: in jure autem regum et populorum facilius est
ut condonatio aliqua intelligatur facta, si modo verba aut con-
jecturae non improbabiles suppetant3 maxime vero sijus de quo
agitur nou liquidum erat, sed in controversia positum. Benig-

right, as far as it eoneerns the relations of kings and peoples, must
bc conceived to be remitted, on this account3 that a peace will be no
peace, if the old causes of war are left standing. And here, demands
which were not known of, will be included in the general words: as
with respect to the Roman merchants who had been drowned by the
Carthaginians, without the Romans knowing it. The best pacifications
arc those which obliterata anyer ancl the monzei-y os offenses, as DIOnysius
says. So Isocrates.

XVIII. The rights of private persons to a penalty, do not offer
the same reason for being supposed to be remitted3 because they
might be exacted without the arbitrament of war. But still, since this
right is not ours iu the same way as one which arises from an inequa-
lity, and punishment has always in it something odious, a slight impli-
cation of words will suffice to make it understood that such penalties
also are to be remitted.

XIX. What we have said, that the right which existed before the
war is not lightly to be supposed to be taken away, is to be firmly held
with regal-d to the rights of private persons. In the rights of kings
and peoples, we may more easily suppose some condonation to take
