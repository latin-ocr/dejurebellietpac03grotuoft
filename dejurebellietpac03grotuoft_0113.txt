loca ab hostibus capta, ita et religiosa talia esse desinere scrip-

priests were excludedsrom the threshold of the temple. But Pompey, as
the same writer relates, entered the temple by the right of victory,
or, as Augustine says, not with the devotion of α worshipper, but with
the claim qf a conqueror: and he did well in sparing the temple and
the things therein, although, as Cicero plainly says, not through
religion, but shame and the sear of obloquy3 but ill in that he en-
tered, doing so out of contempt for the true God ; as also the Chal-
deans are condemned by the prophets for doing. And some think that
it was on this account that, by a peculial· providence of God, Pompey
was slain almost within sight of Judea, at Casius, a promontory of
Egypt. But if you regard the opinion of the Romans, there was in
what he did nothing contrary to the Law of N ations. So the same

temple was consigned to destruction by Titus, as Josephus sayS, by
the Laws of War.

III. What we have said of sacred places is also to be understood
of burial-places 3 for these do not belong to the dead but the living,
either a people or a family. And thus as sacred places taken by
the enemy cease to be sacred, so do places of buria13 as Paulus and
Pomponius write : The sepulchres qs enemies are not objects of reliyz'on
to us,· and therefore we may convert to any use stenes therein taken.
