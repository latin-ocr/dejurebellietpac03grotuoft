138 “ DE JURE ACQUIRENDI BELLo CAPTA. [Lm. 111.

quam capta bello sifsna pro supellectile domi statuere. Ita
et Verri peculatus invidiam auget Cicero, quod signum sustu-
lisset, et quidem captum de praeda hostium.

3 N ec Imperatores tantum, sed et milites peculatus praedae
nomine tenebantur, si nempe eam in publicum non detulissent:
adigebantur enim omnes sacramento, ut ait Polybius, περὶ
τοῦ μηδένα νοσφίζεσθαι μηδὲν τῶν ἐκ τῆς διαρπαγῆς, ἀλλὰ
τηρεῖν τήν πίστιν κατὰ τὸν ὅρκον· nihil quemquam ex praeda
inter-versurum, secl fidem servaturos ex reliyione sacramenti.
Quo forte referri potest formula jurisjurandi apud Gellium,
³qua militi imperatur ne quid tollat in exercitu decemque

millia passuum prope, quod pluris sit nummi argentei, aut si ,

sustulerit ad consulem proferat, aut triduo proximo profiteatur.
Hinc intelligi potest quid sit quod Modestinus dicit: is qui
praedam ab hostibus captam surripuit peculatus tenetur:
quod vel unum satis esse debuit ut juris interpretes moneret
ne ex hostibus capta singulis acquiri crederent, cum constet

ι. 1. cod. m. peculatum non esse nisi in re publica, sacra, aut religiosa.

Hoec omnia eo pertinent, ut appareat, quod supra diximus,

Verres, that he had appropriated an image, and that one taken as spoil
from the enemy.

3 And not the generals only, but the soldiers also, were held
accountable for peculation of prize-treasure3 that is, if they did not
transfer it to the public. For all were bound by the military oath,
as Polybius says, not to appropriate any part of their booty, but to
keep their good faith as sworn. And to this perhaps we may refer
the formula of oath in Gellius, by which the soldier is commanded
not to take anything, within ten miles of the army, of more value
than a silver nummus (sesterce), or if he did take it, to bring it to
the consul, 01· to announce it within three days. Hence we may un-
derstand what Modestinus says3 He who secretes booty taken from
the enemy is gyuz'lty of peculafflmm and this passage alone might
satisfy juristical interpreters, that they are not to suppose that what
individuals take from the enemy becomes their own: since pecula-
tion can only apply to property public, sacred, or religious. All
these cases concur to make it appear, as we have said above, that set-
ting aside the Civil Law, and primarily, things taken by military
operations become the property of the people or king who are carry-
ing on the war.
