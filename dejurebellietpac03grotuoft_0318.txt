308 DE FIDE INTER HOSTES. [LIB. ΙΙΙ.

qui liber esse debuit. Hoc vero sicut fatemur interdum locum
habere, ita non ad omnia promissa praedonibus facta pertinet:
nam ut cui promissum quid est, ad liberandum promissorem
teneatur, opus est, ipse metu injusto causam promisso dederit3.
Si quis ergo ut amicum vinculis eximeret promiserit pretium,
tenebitur: huic enim metus illatus non est, qui ad contrahen-
dum sponte venit.

V. Adde quod et qui injusto metu coactus promisit, te-
neri poterit, accedente jurisjurandi religione: nam inde, ut
alibi diximus, homo non homini tantum, sed et Deo obstrin-
gitur, adversus quem metus exceptio non est. Verum tamen
est, ex tali vinculo solo promittentis heredem non teneri, quia
in heredem transeunt quae in humano sunt commercio ex pri-
maeva dominii lege, at in his non est jus illud Deo quaesitum
qua tale. Iterum illud quoque cx superioribus repetendum
est, si quis fidem juratam aut injuratam praedoni datam violet,
eum eo nomine poenam apud alias gentes non debiturum: quia
odio praedonum placuit gentibus, quae adversus eos etiam vi-
tiose committuntur, dissimulare.

because he inflicted damage by injustice 3 that is, by an act which is at
variance with the nature of human liberty, and with the nature of an
act which ought to be free. But though we allow that this may some-
times hold, it does not apply to all promises made to robbers. For,
that he to whom a promise has been made, should be bound to liberate
the promiser, it is necessary that he should have caused the promise
by unjust fear. If, then, any one have promised a payment in order
to extricate a friend from captivity‚ he is bound by his promise3 for
he has not been put in sear, but comes and makes the contract of his
own free will.

V. Add to this, that even he who, under the infiuence of unjust
sear, has made a promise, may be bound if the sanction of an oath be
added. For then, as we have elsewhere said, man is not bound to
man only, but to God also, towards whom sear is not an exception. It
is however true, that, by such a bond of itself, the heir of the promiser
is not bound3 because what passes to the heir is only what belongs to
human commeree, from the primeva] law of ownership: and the right
which belongs to God, as such, is not included among such things.
And moreover we must again repeat what we have said above3 that if
any one violate his faith given to a robber, either with or without an
oath‚ he is not on that account liable to punishment at the hands of
