LaW, as laid down by modern authors: namely (see E. M. 1087, 1088),
That N eutrals have no right of carrying Mmzicions of Wm, (Grotius's
first class of supplies, called Contraband os W 0⁶⁷3) to one of the
belligerents; and that they have no right of carrying anything to a
place in a state os Blockade]

munitions of war were not declared prize; still less goods of a peaceful cha-
raeter.

I do not deny that the northern nations asserted other rules, but variously, and
rather for an occasional purpose than as a permanent rule of equity. For when
the English, under pretence of their wars, had interfered with the Danish com-
merce, a war arose between those two nations, of which the event was that the
Danes imposed a tribute on England, which, under the name of the Danes’ penny,
remained, though the alleged reason was changed, to the time of William the Con-
queror‚ the founder of the present dynasty in England, as Thuanus notes in the
history of 1589. Again, Elizabeth, the sagacious queen of England, sent in 1575,
Sir William Winter, and Robert Beal, secretary of state, to Helland to complain
that the English could not allow the Dutch, in the heat of the war, to detain, as
they had done, English ships bound to Spanish ports. So Reidan relates in his
Batavian history, at the year 1575, and Camden, at the following year. But when
the English had themselves gone to war with the Spanish, and interfered with the
right of the German cities to sail to Spain, how doubtful the right was by which
they did this, appears from the adverse arguments of both nations‚ which deserve to
be read for the purpose of understanding this controversy. And it may be noted
that the English themselves acknowledge this 3 since the two main arguments
which they allege are, that what the Germans carried into Spain were munitions
of war, and that there were old conventions which prohibited such an aet. And
conventions of this kind were made by the Hollanders and their allies, with the
Lubeckers and their allics in the year 16133 to the effect that neither party should
