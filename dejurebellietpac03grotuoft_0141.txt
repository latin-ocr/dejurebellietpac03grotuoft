5 In divisione interdum et absentium habita ratio, ut
capto Anxure constituit Fabius Ambustus3 interdum ob causam ων. iv. 59.

bam, qui aegre ferebat, quod militibus tienda ipse locuples fieri poterat. J. B.
suis praeda data non fuisset, in qua par-

 

portion was rather what was really meant by manubioe, as Asconius
Pedianus.

4 But those persons are more praised who, giving up their right,
took no part of the booty to themselves3 like Fabricius, of whom I
have spoken, Who in his love of ylory put asida even just qaia, as Dio-
nysius says3 which he said he did according to the example of Vale-
rius Publicola, and a few others. And these, M. Porcius Cato also
imitated in his Spanish victory3 asserting that nothing should come
to him from the spoils of war, except what he had spent in meat
and drink: adding however, that he did not blame the generals who
had accepted the advantages usually granted3 but that he would rather
contend for the prize of virtue with the best, than for the pre-emi-
nence in wealth with the richest. Nearest to this praise come those
who have taken to themselves a moderate share of the prize-trea-
sure3 as Pompey in Lucan is praised by Cato, for having given up
more than he kept.

5 In the division, there is sometimes account taken of those who
have been abse11t; as Fabius Ambustus directed when Anxur was
taken. And sometimes for some special reason account is not taken
of some of those who were present, as of the Minutian army, by the
dictator Cincinnatus.
