From the Times.

“Students of the Bible should be particu-
larly grateful (to the CambrIdge University
Press) for having produced, with the able as-
sistance of Dr Scrivener, a complete critical
edition of the Authorized Version of the Eng-
lish Bible, an edition such as, to use the words
of the Editor, ‘would have been executed long
ago had this version been nothing more than
the greatest and best known of English clas-
sics.' Falling at a time when the formal revi-
sion of this version has been undertaken by a
distinguished company of scholars and divines‚
the publication of this edition must be con-

Syndics of the Cambridge University Press,
an edition of the English Bible, according to

later issues on principles stated by him in his
Introduction. Here he enters at length into
the history of the chief editions of the version,
and of such features as the marginal notes, the
use of italic type, and the changes of ortho-
graphy‚ as well as into the most interesting
question as to the original texts from which
our translation is produced.”

From the London Quarterly R eview.
“ The work is worthy in every respectos the
editor's fame, and of the Cambridge University

Press. The noble English version, to which

conjunction with Shakspeare, and in an im-
our country and religion owe so much, was

langnage beyond any possibility of important probably never presented before in so perfect a
change. Thus the recent contributions to the form.''
