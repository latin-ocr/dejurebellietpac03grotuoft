ΟΑΡ. XXI] UBI DE INDUCIIS, COMMEATU, ETC. 381

XXIX. 1 Quaeri et hoc solet, an pretium conventum et
ante mortem non solutum ab herede debeatur. Expedita
mihi videtur responsio, si in carcere mortuus est, non deberi:
promisso enim inerat conditio, si liberaretur: mortuus autem
non liberatur. Contra, si mortuus est cum in libertate esset,
deberi. Jam enim lucratus erat id, pro quo promissum erat
pretium.

2 Plane fateor et aliter conveniri posse, ut ab ipso con-
tractus momento pure debeatur pretium, et captivus tantum
retineatur, non jam ut jure belli captus, sed ut a se oppigno-
ratus: et contra pactum iniri posse, ut procedat pretii solutio,
si die praestituto, qui captus sit, liber vivat. Sed haec ut
minus naturalia non praesumuntur acta, nisi manifestis docu-
mentis.

XXX. Proponitur et illud, an in carcerem redire debeat,
qui dimissus est sub pacto, ut faceret dimitti alterum, qui
factum morte praevenerit. Diximus alibi, factum tertii libe-
raliter promissum satis impleri, si nihil omittitur ex parte
promissoris3 at in onerosis obligari promissorem ad id, quod

could not be the possessor of it. From which it follows, that property
so concealed may be applied to furnish the amount of ransom3 tho
ownership having been retained by the prisoner.

XXIX. 1 This is also a frequent question: whether the ransom
agreed upon, and not paid before death, be due from the heir. The
answer appears to me to be obvious, if the prisoner die in captivsty,
that it is not due: for the promise was, on the condition that the
prisoner should be liberated, and a dead man is not liberated. On
the other hand, if he dies when he is at liberty, it is due3 for he
had already got the thing for which the price was promised.

2 I undoubtedly confess that the agreement may be made other-
wise, so that, from the moment of the eontract, the price may be abso-
lutely due, and the prisoner may be retained, not now as a prisoner
of war, but as a pledge given by himself: and on the other hand, that
it may be covenanted that the payment of the price shall take place,
if on a certain appointed day, he who is captive, be alive and free.
But such conditions, as being less natural, are not to be presumed,
except upon manifest evidence.

XXX. This question also is propounded: whether lae ought to
return into captivity, who was set free, on the compact that he should
cause another to be liberated, who, by dying, prevented that being
done. We have elsewhere said that the liberal promise of a third
person is fulfilled with sufficient exactness, if nothing be omitted on
