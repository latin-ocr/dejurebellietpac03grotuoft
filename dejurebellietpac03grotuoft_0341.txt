XV. Si nihil aliud convenerit, omni pace id actum cen-
seri debet, ut quae bello data sunt damna, eorum nomine actio
non sit: quod de damnis etiam privatim acceptis intelligen-
dum est: nam et haec belli effecta sunt. In dubio enim ita
censentur contrahere voluisse bellantes, ut neuter injustitiae
damnaretur.
XVI. Non tamen et quae privatis deberi coeperunt belli Dec. com- 61-
tempore condonata censeri debent, nam haec non belli jure
quaesita sunt, sed bello tantum exigi vetita. Itaque sublato
impedimento vim suam retinent. J us vero quod ante bellum

also of losses to private persons3 for these are the effects of war. For
in a doubtful matter, the contracting belligerent parties are to bo
supposed to have intended that neither should be condemned as
unjust.

XVI. But debts which were due to private persons at the time of
the war breaking out, are not to be supposed cancelled3 for these are
· not acquir-ed by the right of war, but only prevented by war from
being exacted. And therefore, when the impediment is removed,
they retain their force. But though the right which existed before
the war, is not lightly to be supposed to be taken from any one, (for
