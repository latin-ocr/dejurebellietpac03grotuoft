CAP. VL] DE JURE AOQUIRENDI BELLO GAPTA. 135

XX. 1 Neque vero diversis tantum bellis aliter atque
aliter usurpatum, sed eodem bello eadem praeda saepe in usus
diversos impensa, aut partibus divisis, aut rerum generibus
distinctis. Sic Camillus decimam ex praeda iApollini Pythio
dedit, Graecorum exemp10, sed quod primitus ab Hebraeis
venerat: quo tempore sub decima praedae vota, non res mo-
ventes tantum, sed et urbem, et agros venire a pontificibus
judicatum est. Eodem victore praedae de Faliscis pars maxima
ad quaestorem redacta est, haud ita multum militi datum. Sic
et L. Manlius proedam aut vendidit, quod ejus in publicum
rediymdum erat, aut cum cura ut quam oequissimd esset
per milites divisit : quae Livii verba sunt.

2 Genera in quae praeda dividi potest sunt haec: homines
captivi, armenta, et greges, quae Graeci, cum proprie loquuntur
λείαν vocant, pecunia, res mobiles aliae, pretiosae aut viliores
Q. Fabius Volscis devictis λείαν et spolia per quaestorem vendi
jubet: argentum ipse defert. Idem Volscis et AEquis devictis
captivos extra Tusculanos militi donat, et in agro Ecetrano

XX. 1 But not only have different usages prevailed in different
wars, but in the same war the same booty has often been applied to
different uses, either by dividing it into parts, or by distinguishing
the kind of objects. Thus Camillus dedicated the tenth part of 1116
spoil to Pythian Apollo, following the example of the Greeks, which
however, came originally from the Hebrews: and at that time, the
dedication of a tenth of the spoil was held by the priests to include,
not moveables only, but the lands and the city. By 1116 same gene-
ral, when victorious over the Falisci, the greater part of the booty
was transferred to the questor, and a small part only given to the
soldiers. So L. Manlius, either sold the spoil, that part of ic which was
to 90 to the public, or divided it among] 1116 soldiers, taking) care that
the division should be exactly fair, as Livy says.

2 The classes of objects into which spoil may be divided, are
these: men, captiveS‚ hei-ds and fiocks, which the Greeks, when they
speak strictly, call λείας money and other moveables, either precious
or common. Q. Fabius, when he had conquered the Volsci, ordered
the λεία and spoils to be sold by the questor3 he himself managed
the money. The same, when the Volsci and AEqui were conquered,
gave to the soldiers the captives, except the Tusculans3 and in the
land of Ecetra, gave up men and cattle to pillage. L. Cornelius,
when Antium was taken, transferred to the trcasury the gold, silver,
