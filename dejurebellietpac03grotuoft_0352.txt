mus, non solet illa pendere a conditione casuali. Sed alter
optabit, an expectare malit, si qua spes sit impleri promissum
serius posse, an aestimationem accipere, an mutuis praestationi-
bus isti capiti respondentibus aut aequum valentibus liberari.

XXXVIII. Certe, etiam post laesam fidem, integrum est
innocenti pacem servare, sieut Scipio fecit post multa Car-
thaginiensium perfida facta, quia contra obligationem faciendo
nemo se obligationi eximit: et, si additum est, ut tali facto
pax rupta habeatur, adjectum id censeri debet in commodum
innocentis duntaxat, si eo uti velit.

XXXIX. Postremo diximus, pacem solvi faciendo id, quod
specialis pacis natura repudiat.

XL. 1 Sic quae contra amicitiam sunt, rumpunt pacem,
quae sub amicitiae lege contracta est: quod enim inter ceteros
solius amicitiae officium exigeret, hic etiam pacti jure praestan-
dum est. Et huc, non vero ad quamvis omnino pacem (est
enim et fedus, non amicitiae eausa, ut nos Pomponius docet)

fulfilled what was promised3 for instance, if the thing demanded have
perished‚ or been taken away, or the aet have become impossible by
any event 3 the peace indeed shall not be broken 3 for, as we have said, it
does not commonly depend on a easual condition. But the other party
must have the option, whether he will rather wait, if there be any hope
that the promise can be fulfilled at a later peri0d3 or receive the
estimated value of his loss3 or be liberated by mutual concessions
corresponding to that article, or of the like value.

XXXVIII. Undoubtedly even after saith has been violated, it is
open to the blameless party to observe the peace3 as Scipio did, after
many perfidious acts of the Carthaginians3 because no one, by acting
against his obligation, exempts himself from his obligation: and if it
be added in the treaty, that in such a ease the peace is to be under-
stood to be broken, this is to be supposed added only for the benefit
of the innocent party, if he choose to use the liberty given.

XXXIX. Lastly, we have said that the peace is broken, by doing
that which the special nature of the peace repudiates.

XL. 1 Thus, acts which are against friendship, break a peace
which was contracted under the law of friendship: for what, between
others, the office of friendship only would require, is here also to be
performed by the covenanted right. And to this case, but not to
every peace whatever, (for there are leagues not for the sake of
