imperii cnon quidem jus totum, sed exet-citio et quasi tutela
erit penes populum, aut eum cui id populus commiserit.

2 De his tamen quae privatim sua sunt si quid pepigerit
rex etiam captivus valebit, ad exemplum eorum quae de pri-
vatis conventionibus dicemus. Quod si exul sit reX, ‘¹ pacemne
facere poterit? sane, si constet eum non obnoxium vivere:
ceteroqui parum a captivo sors ejus distabit: nam sunt et
laxae custodiae. Regulus sententiam in senatu dicere recusa-
vit, dicens, quamdiu jurejurando hostium teneretur, non esse
se senatorem.

IV. In procerum aut populi imperio jus paciscendi
erit penes majorem partem, illic consilii publici, hic civium
sententiae dicendae jus ex more habentium, secundum ea quae
diximus alibi. Itaque sic pacta obligabunt etiam eos qui ali-
ter senserunt. Livius: ubi semel decretum erit, omnibus id,
etiam quibus ante displicuerit, pro bono atque utili federe
defendendum. Dionysius Halicarnassensis: δίκαιον πείθεσθαι
τοῖς ὑπὸ πλειόνων κριθεῖσιν· parendum liis quse pars major
censuerit. Appi-anus: δεῖ πάντας τὸ κριθὲν ἀπροφασίστως

‘1 Pacemne facere poterit] Lucanus:

intellect, cannot make peace. The same is to be said of a king in
captivsty, provided hc received his sovereignty from the people3 for
it is not to be supposed that they would bestow the power, to be
used by a person who was not free. Hence, in this case, the sove-
reignty, not indeed as to its whole rights, but as far as exercise and
guardianship, will be with the people, or him to whom the people
commits it.

2 But as to things which belong to himself, if a king, even in
captivity, make any compact, it will be valid, according to the example
of private conventions‚ of which we have spoken. But it' the king bc an
exile, can he make peace? ch, if he is under no constraint3 other-
wise, his condition differs little from that of a captive: for the custody
of a captive is often lax. Regulus refused to deliver his opinion in

the Senate, saying that so long as he was under an oath to the
enemy, he was not a senator.

IV. In an aristocratical or democratical state, the right of mak-
ing treaties will be with the majority, respectively, of the Council, and
of the Asscmbly of citizens who have a vote, as we have elsewhere
said. Therefore conventions so made, bind them also who dissented.
