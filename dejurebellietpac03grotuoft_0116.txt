106 DE JURE 'AOQUIRENDI BELLo CAPTA. [Lm. 111.

dem bello justo ea nobis acquiruntur aquae aut paria sunt ei
quod cum nobis sit debitum aliter consequi non possumus, aut
etiam quae nocenti damnum inferunt bintra aequum poenae mo-
dum, ut alibi dictum est. Hoc jure Abrahamus de spoliis,
quae a quinque regibus acceperat, cdecimam Deo dedit, ut
historiam quae exstat Gen. xiv. explicat divinus Scriptor ad
Hebraeos vii. 4, quo more Graeci quoque, Carthaginienses, et
Romani diis suis, ut Apollini, Herculi, J ovi Feretrio decimam
de praeda sacraverunt. J acobus autem J osepho prae fratribus
praecipuum relinquens legatum, do tibi, inquit, partem unam
supra fratres tuos, quam α manu Amorrhaei cepi yladio meo
et arou meo, Gen. xlviii. 22. Quo in loco dillud cepi pro-
phetico loquendi genere pro certo capiam sumi videtur, et
Jacobo attribui, quod posteri ab ejus nomine dicti facturi
erant, quasi eadem esset progenitoris et liberorum persona.
Id enim rectius, quam cum Hebraeis verba haec trahere ad
illam expilationem Sicimorum, quae jam ante a filiis Jacobi

other effect peculial· to a war regular according to the Law of
Nations ε namely, acquisition.

By Natural Law we acquire in a just war such things as are equi-
valent to a debt due to us which we cannot otherwise obtain, or such
things as inflict 011 a guilty person a reasonable measure of punish-
ment, as we have explained elsewhere. By this right Abraham gave
of the spoil which he had taken from the five kings, a tenth to God,
as the narrative in Gen. xiv· is explained bytho writer to the Hebrews,
vii. 4. And in the same way the Greeks, the Carthaginians, and the
Romans, consecrated a tenth of their booty to their gods, Apollo,
Hercules, and Jupiter Feretrius. And Jacob, leaving to Joseph his
legacy, sayS, I yive thee a portion above thy brethren which Ι took from
the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with ‘my bow: Gen. xlviii.
22. In which place the word took· seems to be used by a prophetie
mode of speaking for shall take ; and that is ascribed to Jacob which
his posterity were to do: as if the progenitor and his descendants
were the same person. For this is a better explanation than to refer
it to the plunder of the Shechemites, which had been already perpe-
trated by the sons cf Jacob: for that deed Jacob, as a pious man,
always condemned. Gen. xxxiv. 303 xlix. 6.
