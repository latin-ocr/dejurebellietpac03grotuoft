2 But they are mistaken, who think that this rule comes from the
external Law of Nations: for if you look at that, as any one has a
right to seize an enemy's property, as we have shewn above, so has
he a right to kill the enemy: for in the eye of that laW, enemies are
held for nobodies. And therefore Cato's doctrine comes from the
military discipline of the Romans: of which the rule was, as Modes-
tinus has noted, that he who did not obey orders, should be capitally
punished, even if the aet turned out well. And he was understood
not to have obeyed orders, who had, out of the regular ranks, without
the command of the general, fought with the enemy3 as the orders
issucd by Manlius prove to us: on this account namelyg that if such
conduct were permitted, either posts would be deserted, or even, as
the license went further, the army, or a part of it, would be implicated
in easual combats, which was by all means to be avoided. So Sallust,
speaking of the Roman discipline, says, In war those are often puozislzed
who, contrary to orders, havefouyht tlte enemy, or who, berny ordered to
retreat, have been stow in doinss so. The Lacedaemonian who, when
