ditis, ex ea pecunia aurum matronis quod contulerant persolvit,

bio, a town of the AEqui‚ sent the more precious parts of the spoil
to Rome, and divided the rest according to centuries. Camillus,
when Veii was taken, assigned nothing to the public except the
money from the sale of the captives. When the Hetrusei were con-
quered, and the captives sold, out of the money he repaid to the
matrons the gold which they had contributed, and placed three
golden paterae in the Capitol. When Cossus was dictator, all the

dius, when the camp of Hannibal was taken, sold the booty and
divided it, giving donations to those who had performed eminent
services. Scipio, when Carthage was taken, gave up to pillage what
