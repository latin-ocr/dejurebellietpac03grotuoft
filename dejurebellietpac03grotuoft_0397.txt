si quis testationem interposuerit semetipsum obligari nolle,
quia et damni dati et poenae justae debitum cum delicto non
voluntario sed naturali nexu cohaerent.
V. Quia vero semper aut summa potestas obligatur, aut
minister ejus, ideo et certum est partem alteram obligari, nec
dici posse claudicare contractum. Egimus de comparatione
eorum, qui medii sunt, ad superiores.
VI. Videamus et quid in inferiores possint. Nec puto
dubitandum, quin dux milites, magistratus oppidanos obligent
intra eos actus qui solent ab ipsis imperari: alioqui consensu
opus esset. Contra, ducis aut magistratus pactum inferiori· 3255ng

comprehensum satis est: in his quae onus annexum habent,
intra ea quae imperari solent, omnino; extra ea, ita si accep-

V. And since, in all cases, either the supreme power is bound, or
its minister, it is therefore certain that the other party is bound also:
nor can it be alleged that the contract is one-sided.

We have considered the relation of subordinates to superiors3 let
us now see what power they have over inferiors.

VI. I have no doubt, that a General can bind soldiers, and
a Magistrate, citizens, within the limits of those acts which are cus-
tomarily done at their command: in other cases, consent is necessary.
On the other side, the compact of a general or magistrate will give
advantages to their inferiors absolutely, in things simply useful 3 for
that was sufficiently comprehended in their power: also in those
things which have an onus annexed to the utility, within the limits
of t'neir customary command, absolutely: and out of those limits, if
they accept the compact3 which agrees with what we have delivered
concerning stipulations for a third party on grounds of Natural Law.
