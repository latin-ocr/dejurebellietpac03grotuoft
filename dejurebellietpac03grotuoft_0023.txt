tending to reduce Athens by famine, and when a ship attempted to
introduce corn into the city, he hung the captain and the pilot of the
ship, and thus, deterring others, became master of the city.

VI. 1 As to the mode of acting in war, force and terror aro the
appropriate means. Whether it is allowable to use stratagem also, is a

lading was paid for. But the French, when French ships going to Spain were
confiscated by the English, shewed that they would not tolerate this. Therefore
we have rightly said that public declarations are required. And this the English
themselves saw the necessity of. For they made such public declaration in 1591
and 1598, as we see in Camden.

Nor have such declarations always been obeyed, but times, causeS, and places
have been made grounds of distinctions. In 1458 the city of Lubeck refused to obey
a notice given to them by the Dantzickers, that they were not to trade with the
people of Malmoge and Memel. Nor did the Hollanders in 1551 obey, when the
Lubeokers gave them notice to abstain from traffic with the Danes with whom
they were then at war. In the year 1522, when there was a war between Sweden
and Denmark‚ when the Danes had asked the Hanseatic cities not to have com-
merce with the Swedes, some of the cities who had need of their friendship con-
formed to this, but others did not. The Hollanders, when war was raging
between Sweden and Poland, never allowed their commerce with either nation to
be interdicted. The French always restored the Dutch ships which they took
either going to or coming from Spain, then at war with them. See the pleading
of Louis Servinus, held in 1592, in the case of the Hamburghers. But the same
Dutch did not allow the English to carry merchandize into Dunkirk, before which
they had a fleet3 as the Dantzickers in 1455 did not allow the Dutch to carry any-
thing into Konigsberg. [See the authorities.

See also the subsequent views entertained on this subject, Ε. Μ 1085-1091,
and the authorities there quoted]

[Grotius's note] f There is much on this subject in Meursius's Danish His-
tory, B. 1. and 11. There you will see that the Lubeckers and the Emperor are
for commerce, the Dones against it. Also see Crantzius, Thuanus, as quoted,

camden, besides the passages already quoted, on the years 1589 and 1595 3 where
that controversy between the English and those Germans whom thoy call the
Hanse towns is treated of.
