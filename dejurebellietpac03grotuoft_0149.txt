CAP. VL] DE JURE ACQUIRENDI BELLO OAPTA. 139

semota lege civili, et primo, in bellicis actibus capta populi
aut regis bellum gerentis fieri.

XXII. 1 Addidimus semota lege civili et primo, sive
directe: illud quia de rebus nondum actu quaesitis lex ad uti-
litatem publicam potest imperare, sive lex illa lex populi est,
ut apud Romanos, sive regis, ut apud Hebraeos et alibi. Sub
legis autem nomine etiam consuetudinem recte introductam
volumus comprehendi. Alterum illud eo pertinet, ut sciamus
sicut res alias ita et praedam posse a populo aliis concedi, nec
tantum post acquisitionem, sed et ante eam, ita ut subsecuta
captura conjungantur actiones brevi manu, ut loquuntur juris-
consulti: nec tantum ea concessio nominatim fieri potest, sed
et in genere, ut viduis, senibus, et egentibus pupillis pars
praedae data est temporibus Maccabaicis, aut etiam personis ggssggwwiii·
incertis ad exemplum missilium, quae Romani consules capien- ' ’
tium faciebant.

2 Neque vero haec juris translatio, quae lege aut concessu
fit, semper mera donatio est, sed interdum contractus, inter-
dum aut solutio ejus quod debetur, aut remuneratio ob damna
quae quis passus est, aut ob id quod ipse bello impendit, sive
sumtu, sive opera, ut cum socii aut subditi nullo stipendio
militant, aut non tali quod operae respondeat. Nam ex his

 

XXII. 1 Ι have added “setting aside the Civil LaW, and prima-
rily,'' that is, directly. The first clause, because concerning things
not yet actually acquired, the law may regulate according to public
utility3 whether the law be made by the people, as among the Ro-
mans, or by the king, as among the Hebrews and elsewhere. And
under the name of “laW,'' I also include custom rightly introduced.
The other clause, “primarily,'' tends to this: that we mean that spoil,
like other things, may be conceded by the people to others, not only
after acquisition, but also before; so that when the capture follows,
the two events may be conjoined brevi manzo, so as to be one, as the
jurists speak. And such concession may be made, not only naming⁴
each person, but by classes 3 as in the times of the MaccabeeS, a part
of the spoil was given to widows, old men, and needy orphans3 or
even to uncertain persons, as in a scramble, in which the Roman
consuls gave things to those who caught them.

2 And this transfer of right (from the public to private persons,)
which is made by law or concession, is not always a mere donation,
but sometimes a contract, sometimes a payment of what is due, or a
. remuneration for losses suffered, or expenses incurred in the war,
either in the way of payment or of work done3 as when allies and
