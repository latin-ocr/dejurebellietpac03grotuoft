rulers. But it may be provided that this shall not be done, by adding a
covenant‚ that the hostages shall be given up, when that, on account
of which they were given, has been fulfilled.

LVI. He who is given as a hostage, only to redeem another who is
a prisoner οι· a hostage, is liberated, on the death of that other. For
in him, when he dies, the right of the pledge is extinguished3 as Ulpian
said of a prisoner who is ransomed [and dies before the ransom is
paid]. Wherefore, as in Ulpian's question, the price is not due, so here
too, the person of the vicarious hostage is not bound. Thus Demetrius
justly demanded of the Roman senate to be set free, as having been
given up for Antiochus, and Antiochus being dead. This being so, he
said he did not know whom he was hostage for.

LVII. When the king is dead who made the convention, whether
the hostage be still bound, depends on the question which we have
elsewhere treated, whether the convention is to be held personal or
real: for accessory circumstances, such as hostages, cannot be a reason
for receding from the rule, in the interpretation of the main article&
The accessories must follow the nature of the main business.
