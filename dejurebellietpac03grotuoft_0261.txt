OAP. XIII.] TEMPERAMENTUM CIROA RES CAPTAS. 251

intelligendum enim hoc usquc dum secundum sanum judicium
satisfactum sit de eo damno quod in ipso bello datum est:
sio in disceptatione cum Antiocho Romani, Livio narrante, nib. xxxvii.
cimpensam, quae in bellum facta esset, omnem praestare regem ὦ
aequum censebant, cujus culpa bellum excitatum esset. Apud
J ustinum est impensas belli leffe justa ³suscepturus: apud Lib-xxxiii.1.
Thucydidem damnantur Samii χρήματα τά ἁναλωθέντα Lib.i.117.
ἀποδοῦναι, solvere belli impensas. Et alibi saepe. Quod
autem victis juste imponitur, idem et bello juste extorquetur.

IV. 1 Ceterum sciendum est, quod et alibi meminimus,
latius patere caritatis quam juris regulas. Qui divitiis floret,
immisericordiae reus erit, si inopem debitorem omnibus reculis
suis excutiat, ut ipse ultimum quadrantem consequatur, mul-
toque magis si is ipse debitor in id debitum venerit sua boni-
tate, ut si pro amico fidejusserit, ipse autem nihil pecuniae
verterit in rem suam. ‘lMiserabile enim est, ut ait pater Dect. 273.
Quintilianus, sponsoris periculum. Tamen tam durus credi-
tor contra jus stricte dictum nihil facit.

said at the beginning of this Book. And in this sense, we are to take
what is said by some theologians, that captures in war are not to
be reckoned only in the way of compensation for the principal debt.
For this is to be understood until, according to a sound judgment,
satisfaction is made for the damage which has been infiicted in the
war itself. Thus the Romans in their dispute with Antiochus, thought
it a reasonable demand that the king should repay all the expenses
of the war, since by his fault the war took place. So, of the expenses
of the war, in Justin, Thucydides3 and elsewhere frequently. And
what is justly imposed on the conquered, is justly extorted by war.
IV. 1 But here too, We must recollect what we have elsewhere
said, that the rules of charity are wider than those of justice. He
who abounds in wealth, is guilty of want of clemency‚ if he wring a
needy debtor with stringent mles, and exact the uttermost farthing:
and still more, if that debtor have run into the debt by his own good-
ness, as for instance, by being security for a friend, without having
turned any of the money to his own profit. The danyer of α surety

is to be pitied, as Quintilian says. And yet even so hard a creditor
does nothing against strict right.
