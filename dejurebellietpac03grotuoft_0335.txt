societas civilis coita est.

3 At in regnis patrimonialibus quo minus rex regnum
alienet, nihil impedit. Fieri tamen potest ut talis rex partem
aliquam imperii alienare non valeat, si nempe regnum sub
onere ejus non dividendi in proprietatem acceperit. Bona
vero quae regni dicuntur quod attinet, possunt et haec in pa-
trimonium venire regis duobus modis, aut separabiliter, aut
individue cum ipso regno, Si hoe modo, transscribi poterunt,
sed non nisi cum regno: si illud, etiam seorsum.

such a case, when civil society was formed.

3 But in patrimonial kingdoms, there is nothing which preventa
the king alienating his kingdom. Still, it may be, that such a king
has not power to alienate any part of the empire3 namely‚ if he had
received the kingdom as his property, with the omes of not (lividing
it. As to the valuables which are called the Property of the Crown,
they may come into the king’s patrimony in two ways3 either separa-
bly, or inseparably with the kingdom itself. If in the latter mode,
they may be transferred, but only with the kingdom ; if in the former,
they may be transferred separately.

4 As to kings whose kingdom is not patrimonial, they can hardly
have the right of alienating the property of the erown3 except it
appear plainly to be so, from a primeval law or uncontradicted
custom.

VI. How far the king’s suecessors, and the people, are bound by
his promise, we have also stated elsewhere3 namely, so far as the
