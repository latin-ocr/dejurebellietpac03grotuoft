jurando obstrictam tenet. Romani hoc genus ¹¹leges sacratas

appellabant, per quas ipse populus Romanus, ut Cicero pr0[[cap.15.]]
Balbo explieat, religione obligabatur.

2 Est ad hanc rem pertinens disputatio per se obscurior
apud Livium libro tertio, ubi ex sententia multorum juris in·-
terpretum ait tribunos esse sacrosanctos, non etiam aediles,
judices, decemviros, quorum tamen si eui noceretur id non
jure fieret. Causa discriminis est, quod aediles atque alii lege
sola defendebantur: quod autem postremum populus jussisset
id ratum erat, manente tamen lege nemini contra agere jus
erat: at tribunos religio publica populi Romani tuebatur: nam
jusjurandum intercesserat, quod ab his ipsis qui juraverant
salva religione tolli non poterat. Dionysius Halicarnassensis

for the sake of public utility. For the state may give up what is
clearly its own, and the words may be so plain as to allow no exeep-
tion. Valerius Maximus says to the Athenians, Read the Low to which
you are bound by oath. The Romans called such laws Zeyes sacratae.-
and by such, the Roman people itself, as Cicero for Balbus explains,
was in conscience bound.

2 There is a somewhat obscure dissertation on this subject, in the
third Book of Livy, in which he says that, according to the opinion of
many jurists, the tribunes were sacrosaozct, but not the ediles, judges,
decemvirs3 though if harm was done to any of them it was unlawful.
The cause of the differenee is, that the ediles and others were defended
by the law only3 and while the law lasted, no one might act against
it; but the tribunes were defended by the public religious engage-
ment of the Roman people: sor an oath had been administered,
which those who had taken it could not set aside with a safe con-
science. So Dionysius relates the rule established by L. «Tunius Bru-
tus. And hence this law was called sacrata. And therefore good
men condemned the act of Tiberius Gracchus, when he abrogated the
tribuneship of Octavius3 and said that the tribunitian power has its
sacredness from the people, not against the people. And therefore,
