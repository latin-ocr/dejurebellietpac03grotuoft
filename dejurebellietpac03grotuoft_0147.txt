from a Roman superstition, and ordered all to bring in the rest of
the spoi13 and either sold that part of it which was to go to the public,
or divided it with care that the division should be fair*.

Romans, as well as among most other nations, the spoil belonged to
the pcople, but that some discretiori in dividing it was allowed the
general; but, as we have said, in such way that he was responsible
to the peoplo. This appears, among other instances, by the exam-
ple of L. Scipio, who was condemned for peculation, as Valerius
Maximus tells us, as having received four hundred and eighty ses-
terces of silvei· more than he had transferred to the treasury3 and
of others whom we have mentioned.

2 M. Cato, in an oration concerning prize·treasure‚ written, as
Gellius says, in vehement and brilliant languagc, complained of the
impunity and licence of peculation. Of that oration this fragment
is extant : Privata robbers are put in prison aud iu bouds : public rob·
bers are seen in purple und yold. He had elsewhere said that He mar-
veiled that any one could set up in his house imayes which were taken
in war. So Cicero makes it a point to inflame the odium against

the general L. Manlius instead of Cnaeus Manlius. (Gronov.)
