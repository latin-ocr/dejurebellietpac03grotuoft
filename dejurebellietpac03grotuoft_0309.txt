II. 1 Speciale mandatum habere possunt non hi tantum
qui stipendia percipiunt, sed et qui suo sumtu militant, et qui,
quod plus est, suo sumtu partem belli administrant, ut qui
naves instruunt ac sustentant suis impendiis, quibus vice mer-
cedis concedi solet ut capta sua faciant, sicut alibi diximus. Id Lib-iii· 6-
vero quatenus procedat, illaesa justitia interna, et caritate, non
immerito quaeritur.
2 Justitia aut hostem respicit, aut ipsam civitatem cum
qua contrahitur. Hosti diximus eripi posse possessionem
rerum omnium, quae bellum alere possunt, securitatis causa,
sed hoc sub onere reddendi: ipsum vero dominium ad com-
pensationem usque ejus quod aut ab initio belli, aut ex post
facto civitati justum bellum gerenti debetur, sive res sint
civitatis hostilis, sive singulorum, etiam per se innocentium:
bona vero nocentium etiam ex poenae causa adimi et acquiri
capientibus posse. Fient ergo res hostiles eorum, qui belli
partem suo sumtu administrant, quod hostes attinet, hactenus
ut is quem expressi modus non excedatur, quod aequo arbi-
tratu aestimandum est.

who, what is more, support part of the charge of the war3 as for
instance, those who fit out ships, and support them at their own ex-
pense3 and who are allowed, instead of pay, to appropriate their own
captui-es, as we have elsewhere said. But how far this may be done
without violating internal justice and charity, is a question not unwor-
thy of discussion.

2 The justice of the case has respect, either to the enemy, or to
the state with which such contract is made. We have already said
that from an enemy, any possession which may seed the war, may be
taken away for the sake of security3 but this, under the onus of
restoring it: and that the ownership may be taken, so far as eom-
pensation for what was either owing at the beginning of the war, or
has become owing by some subsequent pact, to a state carrying on a
just war; whether such possession belong to the hostile state, or to
individuals, even innocent ones: and that the goods of guilty parties
may, in the way of penalty, be taken from them and acquired by the
captors. And thus, so far as the rights of the enemy are concerned,
hostile property will become the property of those who carry on a
part of the war at their own expense [Privateers], so far as the limit
which has been stated is not exceeded3 which must be estimated by
an equitable opinion.
