CAP. XXI.] UBI DE INDUOEIS, COMMEATU, ETO. 373

X. Sunt et quaedam per inducias illicita, ob specialem
conventionis naturam; ut si tantum sepeliendorum hominum
causa datae sint induciae, nihil erit immutandum: sic ¹si ob-
sessis datae indueiae tantum nc oppugnentur, jam auxilia et
commeatus admittere non licebit: nam cum tales induciae alteri
partium prosint, non debent interim ejus, qui dedit, causam
duriorem facere. Interdum et convenit, ne commeare liceat.
mInterdum personis cavetur, non et rebus: quo casu si ad res
defendendas laedantur personae, nihil contra inducias fiet:
nam cum liccat res defendere, personarum securitas ad id
quod principale est, non quod in alicujus consequentiam venit,

referenda est.

XI. Si fides induciarum a parte altera rumpatur, quin
laeso liberum sit etiam sine indictione ad arma venire, frustra
dubitatur: nam capita conventionis insunt conventioni per
modum conditionis, ut paulo ante diximus. Reperias quidem
in historiis exempla eorum qui sustinuerint in finem inducia-
rum. Sed et bellum illatum Hetruscis et aliis, quod contra

major force excuses the party from the penalty: but in our caso, the
question is not properly concerning penalty, but concerning a right
[of war], which was quiescent only during a certain interval of time.
But that to remit such rights is more humane, and also more gene-

rous, admits of no doubt.
X. There are also some things which are unlawful during· a truce,

in consequence of the special nature of the convention: as if a truce
is granted, only for the sake of burying the dead, nothing is to be
changed; and if a truce is given to a besieged place, only that they
are not to be assaulted, it will then not be lawful to admit aid and
provisions: for since such a truce is given as an advantage to one of
the parties, it ought not to damage the position of him who granted
it. Sometimes also it is stipulated‚ that it shall not be lawful for
persons to pass between the parties. Sometimes such passage is
granted to persons, but not to things3 in which case, if persons are
hurt in resisting tho passage of things, the truce is not broken. For
since it is lawful to oppose the passage of things, the security of per-
sons is to be referred to that which is principal, not to that which is a
matter of consequential result merely.

XI. If the saith of the truce be broken on one side, there is no

ground for doubting whether it be open to the other party to return
to tho employmcnt of arms, even without a declaration3 for the
