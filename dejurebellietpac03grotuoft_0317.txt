CAP. XIX.] DE FIDE INTER HOSTES. 307

actum esset3 at fsi quando cum tali, qua talis est, actum est,
simul de remittenda, quod hanc rem attinet, poena actum cen-
seri debet3 quia, semper, ut alibi diximus, ea sumenda est in-
terpretatio: quae cavet, ne actus in vanum recidat,

2 Non male apud Livium Nabis, cum tyrannidem ipsi Liv. xxxiv.
objiceret Quintius Flaminius: de nomine hoc respondere pos- ω’
sum, me, qualiscumque sum, eundem esse qui fui, cum tu
‘ipse mecum, T. Quinti, societatem pepifyisti. Et mox: jam
feceram hoec, qualiacumque sunt, cum societatem mecum
pepiyistis. Addit, si quid 690 mutassem, mihi mece incon-
stantiae, cum vos mutetis, vobis vestroe ratio reddenda est.
Locus est non dissimilis in oratione Periclis, ad cives suos apud
Thucydidem: ‘reis πόλεις αὐτονόμους ἀφήσομεν, εἰ καὶ αὐτο· Lib i. infin.
νόμους ἔχοντες ἐσπεισάμεθα· civitates socias liberas esse ‘²¹4⁴‘
patiemur, si tales fuerunt quo tempore factum est fedus.

IV. Deinde objici potest, quod alibi diximus, eum qui Lu). ii. ιι.
metu causam dedit promisso, teneri liberare promissorem, ‘³⁷'
quia damnum dedit per injustitiam, id est, per actum pugnan-

as Cicero rightly says. Now among other rights, is this Right bestowed
by a Promise3 therefore this right may be taken fi’om him as a pe-
nalty. To this I answer, that the argument would hold, if the con-
vention with him had been on the supposition of his not being a cri-
minal. But when the treating with such a one has gone on with him
as being such a one, we must suppose that the treaty included the
remission of the penalty, so far as this matter is concerned: because,
as we have elsewhere said, we must suppose such an interpretation,
as provides against the whole act being null and void.

2 In Livy, Nabis well says, when Q. Flaminius objects to him his
being a tyrant: With reqard to that name, Ι can answer, that whatever
Ι am, Iam the same with whom you, Τ. Quintius, have made α ῑ6α9ιι6 of
alliance. And again: I had already done those thinys, ‘whatever their
character be, when you made an alliance with me. He adds, If I had
changed in anythiny, Ι should have had to yive account of my inconsist-
ency ,· as it is, you owe an account of yours. There is a similar pas-
sage in Pericles’s speech to his citizens in Thucydides: W 6 shall
suffer the citios in allz'ance with us to be free, tf they were so when the
treaty was made.

IV. Again, it may be objected that, (as we have said already,) he
who, by means of sear, caused the promise, is held to free the promiser‚
