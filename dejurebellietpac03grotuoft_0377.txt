CAP.XX1.] UBI DE INDUOIIS, COMMEATU, ETG. 367

ciabatur: non longe abit Donatus, cum inducias dictas vult, ?fT15‘'E¹‘'¹'
quod in dies otium praebeant. Sunt ergo induoiae in bello ' ” ”’
otium2, non pax: itaque accurate loquuntur historici, qui figi-15¹⁸&
narrant saepe, pacem negatam, inducias datas. ’
ΙΙΙ. Quare nec nova indictione opus erit: nam sublato Aug> 1- si

impedimento temporali, ipso jure se exserit status belli non {iiiiii-L n.

mortuus sed sopitus, ut dominium et patria potestas in eo guaitam.
qui a furore convaluit. Legimus tamen apud Livium, ex
fecialium sententia finitis induciis indictum bellum: sed nimi-
rum istis non necessariis cautionibus ostendere veteres Ro-
mani voluerunt quantopere pacem amarent, et quam justis de
causis in arma traherentur. Innuit hoc ipse Livius: cum Lib-iv·30·
Veientibus nuper acie dimicatum apud Nomentum et Fide-
nas fuerat, induciaeque inde, non paee facta, quarum et dies
exierat, et ante diem rebellaverant: missi tamen feciales,
nec eorum, cum more patrum jurati repeterent res, verba
Sunt audita.

IV. 1 Tempus induciis asscribi solet aut continuum, ut

in centum dies, aut cum designatione termini, ut usque calen-

orum, factum est ostrea, ostreae. et Gent. Lib. vn. cap. 7. ξ 3, et seqq.

not far from this etymology, when he says that Inducioe were so called
because they give in dies otium, cessation for days. Inducioe, or Truce,
then, is a cessation of acts in war, not a peace3 and therefore the
historians speak accurately, when they say that peace was denied, but
truce granted.

111. And therefore there is no need of a new declaration of war
after a truce: for the temporary impediment being removed, the
state of war comes into play, as a matter of right3 it was not dead,
but only sleeping3 and revives, as the right of ownership or of pater-
nal power revives, in a man who recovers from a state of lunacy.
Still we read in Livy, that in pursuance of the opinion of the Feciales,
when the truce was over, war was declared: but in fact, the old
Romans wished to sheW‚ by those superfluous cautious, how much
they loved peace, and by how just causes they were drawn into arms.
Livy implies this: Truce was yranteoL not peace made ‚· tlte last day of
the truce had passed, and before that day, they had resumed hostilities ,-
yet the Fecialcs were sent, and when they made their formal application,
they were disreyarded.

IV. 1 The time of a truce is commonly defined by its length, as,
for a hundred days; or by fixing the end of the term, as, till the first
