GENERAL ED1TOR: THE VERY REVEREND J. J. S. PEROWNE, D.D.‚
DEAN OF PETERBOROUGH.

 

‘¹ It is difficult to commend too highly this excellent series.''—Guardian.

“The rnodesty os the general title os this series has, we believe. led many to misunderstand
its character and underrate its value. The books are well suited sor study in the upper sortus os
our best schools, but not the less are they adapted to the wants of all Bible students who are not
specialists. We doubt, indeed, whether any os the numerous popular commentaries recently
issued in this country will be found more serviceable for general use.”-Academy.

A! “ One of the most popular and useful literary enterprises os the nineteenth century.'’—Baptist
agazzne.

“Os great value. The whole series of comments for schools is highly esteemed by students
capable os forming a judgment. The books are scholarly without being pretentious: information
is so given as to be easily understood.''—Sword and Trowel.
