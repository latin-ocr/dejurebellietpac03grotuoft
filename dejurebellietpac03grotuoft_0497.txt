‘⁴ lt was originally written in Latin and does not find a place on ordinary bookshelves. A very
great boon has therefore been conserred on the general English reader by the managers osthe
Pitt Press Series, in the issue ofa convenient httle volume of Alore’s Utopz'a not in the original
Latin, but in the quaint English Translation thereos made hy Raphe Robynson, which adds a
linguistic interest to the intrinsic merit of the work. . . . All this has been edited in a most com-
plete and scholarly fashion by Dr J R. Lumby, the Norrisian Professor os Divinity, whose name
alone is a sufficient warrant for its accuracy. It is a real addition to the modern stock osclassical
English literature.'’—Guardian.
