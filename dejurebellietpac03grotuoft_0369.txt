LV. Odiosa autem est obsidum obligatio, tum quia liber-
tati inimica, tum quia ex facto alieno venit. Ideoque stricta
interpretatio hic locum habet: quare in unam causam dati, in
aliam retineri non poterunt: quod ita intellige, si aliud quid
sine obsidum accessione promissum sit. At si in alia causa
fides jam violata sit, aut contractum debitum, jztm poterit
obses retineri, non ut obses, sed eo gentium jure, quo subditi

LIV. It is made a question, whether it is lawful for a hostage to
make his escape. And it appears plainly that it is not lawful, if, either
at first, or afterwards, he have given his word, in order to be in looser
custody. Without such a condition, it would seem that the state had
not the intention of binding its citizen not to escape, but of giving the
enemy the power of keeping him as they chose. And in this way, the
act of Clelia may be defended. But although she had not been in
fault, the city could not receive and keep the hostage. So Porsenna:
If tlte hostaye were not yiven up, he would hold the treaty broken .- and so
the Romans slave up the pledgye os peace accord'inq to the treczty.

LV. However, the obligation of hostages is odious3 both because
it is against liberty, and because it punishes a person for what another
has done. Therefore, in such cases, a strict interpretation is applicable.
And thus, persons given up on one account cannot be retained on
another: which is to be understood with this condition, If anything
else be promised without the stipulation of hostages. But if, in the
other cause, saith have been violated, or a debt contracted, the hostage
may then be retained3 not as a hostage‚ but by that part of the Law
of Nations by which subjects may be detained for the act of their
