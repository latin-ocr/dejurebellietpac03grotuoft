injuria, ipsi quicum pax inita est facta non censebitur, nisi
aperte ad ipsius sugillationem facta sit, quam naturalem aequi-

friendship, as Pomponius teaches us,) I refer many discussions which
occur in lawyers, about injuries not by arms, and. insults‚ and the
like3 and especially that of Cicero: After the return imo qoodwill, ij
any wrong] is covmnitted, that must be considered, not as a ozeylect bnt as a
violation, and assiyned not to oversiyht buc το perfidy. But here also
we must divest the fact of an odious character as much as possible.

2 And hence an injury done to a person connected with or subject
to another, shall not 'be supposed to be done to him with whom tho
peace was made, except it be openly done to insult him. And this'
rule of natural equity is followed by the Roman laws, in weighty
injuries done to another person’s servants: so that adultery or viola-

another person's goods rather constitutos an act of new cupidity, than
of broken saith.

3 Atrocious threats, without any new cause preceding, are at vari-
