that ownership arises from natural possession3 and that a vestige of
this right appears in things which are taken in hunting, and also in
war, which forthwith are the property of the captors.

5 Those things are supposed to be taken from the enemy which
are taken from his subjects. So Dercyllides reasons in Xenophon,
that since Pharnabazus is the enemy of the Laeedaemonians, and
Manias the subject of Pharnabazus, the goods of Manias are in a con-
