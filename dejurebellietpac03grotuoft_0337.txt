buet. Neque hoc onere levabitur civitas, si nunc forte ei
praestationi par· non sit, sed quandocumque copia suppetit,
exseret sese quasi sopita obligatio,

VIII. Neque illud indistincte admitto, quod dicit Fer-di·
naudus Vasquius, agnoscere civitatem non debere id damnum, rsuram
quod jam bello datum est, eo quod jus belli talia permittat. ²H'c'4‘mjm'

ut rei bello amissae causa nulla adversus civitatem actio sit,
ut sua quisque acrius defendat.
IX. Sunt qui latum discrimen collocant inter· ea, quae
civium sunt ex gentium jure, et ea quae eorundem sunt ex
jure civili, ut in haec jus laxius regi concedant, etiam auferendi
sine causa et compensatione, in illa non item τ perverse: nam

bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property 3 and
to this public purpose, among others, he who has suffered the loss
must, if need be, contribute. Nor is the state relieved from this
onus, if, for the present, it be unable to discharge it; but at any future
time, when the means are there, the obligation which had been sus-
pended revives.

VIII. Nor do I admit, without distinction, what Vasquius says3
that the state is not bound to aeknowledge the damage which is
inflicted by war, because the right of war permits such damage. For
that right of war has regard to other peoples, as wc have elsewhere
explained3 and, partly at least, affects enemies in their mutual rela-
tions, not citizens in theirs3 for since these are socially bound toge-
ther, it is just that they bear in common the losscs which happen for
the sake of society. It may however be established by the Civil
Law, that a thing lost in war shall not give a citizen a right of reeo-
very against the State3 in order that each person may the more
strenuously defend his own property.

IX. There are some writers who make a broad distinction be-
tween things which belong to the citizens by the Law of Nations, and
things which belong to them by the Civil Law: so that with regard to
the former, they allow a looser right to the king, so that he may take
them without cause and without compensation3 but not so with regard
to the latter. Wrongly. For ownership, from whatever cause it
