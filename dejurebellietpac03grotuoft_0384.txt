inducias fecissent, legas: quae diversitas argumento est, jus
ita esse ut dicimus, sed eo jure uti vel non uti, in arbitrio
esse ejus, qui laesus est.

XII. Illud constat, si poena conventa poscitur et persol-
vitur ab eo qui contra fecit, jam bellandi jus non esse: ideo
enim poena solvitur, ut cetera salva maneant. Et contra, si
bellum moveatur, recessum a poena censeri debet, quando
optio data est.

XIII. Privata tamen faeta non rumpunt inducias, nisi
publicus actus accedat, puta imperii aut ratihabitionis, quae
etiam intelligitur accedere, si qui deliquerint nec puniantur,
nec dedantur: si non reddantur res.

XIV. J us commeandi extra inducias privilegium quod-

privilegiis traduntur. Est autem hoc privilegium neque ter-

history examples of persons who have continued to bear wrongs
even to the end of the truce. But on the other hand, war was
made against the Hetruseans and others, because they did acts
against the truce; and this diversity is an argument that the right is
as we say3 but that, to use or not to use such right, is at the option
of the injured party.

XII. This is certain, that if the penalty agreed upon is de-
manded and paid by him who has acted against the truce, there is then
no right of going to wal-3 for the penalty is paid that everything else
may remain unviolated. And on the other hand, if the war is resumed,
it is to be considered that the claim of penalty is abandoned, since
the option is given.

XIII. Private acts do not touch a truce, except a public act be
added ; for example, an aet of commanding the thing to be done,
or of accepting it as valid when it is done3 and these public acts
are understood to be adjoined, if those who have offended are
neither punished nor given up; or if the things seized are not re-
