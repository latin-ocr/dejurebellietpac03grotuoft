CAP. IX.] DE POSTLIMINIO. 1 ’75

extra id genus sunt, quod discrimen jam mox explicabimus,
ut illa videantur alienata cum sua causa et sub conditione:
ista vero simpliciter. Alienata autem intelligo etiam quae do-
nata aut acceptilata sunt.
VII. At sicut ad postliminio redeuntem jura redeunt,
ita et jura in ipsum restituuntur, ac pro eo habentur, ut
Tryphoninus loquitur, ac si nunquam ille hostium potitus {31⁶32 §aetas-
fuisset. ’ ⁶¹²*
VIII. Huic regulae de liberis hominibus exceptionem
hanc recte asscribit Paulus: postliminio carent qui armis L-17. ‹ttic-
victi hostibus se dederunt, nimirum quia pactiones cum hos-
tibus factae valent jure gentium, ut alibi dicemus, nec adversus
eas est postliminium. Ideo Romani illi a Poenis capti apud
Gellium: postliminium justum non esse sibi, quoniam deju- Lib-vii-18·
rio vincti forent. Unde et induciarum tempore non esse
postliminium recte a Paulo notatum est. At hos qui hostibus (1123 (ξέρῇ 1· D·
deduntur sine ulla scilicet pactione, postliminio reverti re-
spondit Modestinus. L. 4. d. tit.

populis locum habere arbitror, ut qui liberi fuerunt suam

 

from him? I speak of the property which he had in a neutral state.
Here, it seems, we must make a distinction between things which are
of such a nature that they return by postliminium, and things not of
that nature: which differcnce we shall soon explain. The former
class of things are, it would seem, alicnated with their cause, the pcr-
son, and under condition: the latter are simply alienated. By alien-
ated, 1 mean given away, or acknowledged as received.

VII. And as the person who returns by postliminium recovers
his rights, so also rights against him are restored, and are held the
same as if he had never been in the power of the enemy, as Trypho-
ninus says.

VIII. To this rule concerning free men, Paulus rightly annexed
this exception. Those who surrender themselves, lose postliminium,
namely, because conventions made with an enemy are valid by the law
of nations, and against these, postliminium does not hold. So tho
Romans captured by the Carthaginians, say, in Gellius, that they have
no right to postliminium, since they were captives by right. Whence
during a truce, there is no postliminium, as Paulus rightly notes3 but
those who are surrendered to the enemy without any compact, return
by postliminium, as Modestinus gave his opinion.

IX. 1 What we have said of individuals, I conceive holds also for
a pcople3 so that they who have been free, recovcr their liberty, if it
