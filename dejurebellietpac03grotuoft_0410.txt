tum est, quod et in publicis, etin privatis, et in mixtis
conventionibus usu venit. Causa haec est, quod consensus,
qualitercunque indicatus et acceptatus, vim habet juris transfe-
rendi. Signa autem consensus sunt et alia praeter voces et
literam, ut non semel jam indicavimus. Quaedam natura insunt
actui.

ΙΙ. Exemplum sit in eo qui aut ab hostibus, aut ab ex-
ternis veniens in alterius populi, aut regis fidem se dat: nam
hic quin tacite se obliget, ne quid faciat adversus eum statum
in quo praesidium petit, dubitari non debet. Quare sequendi
non sunt qui Zopyri factum a reprehensione remotum aiunt:

CHAPTER XXIV. Os Tacit Faizh.

I. It is well said by Javolenus, that some things are agreed upon in
silence. This happens in public conmntions, andin private, and in mixed.
The cause is this3 that consent, however indicated and accepted, has
the force of transferring right. But there are other signs of consent,
besides words and letters, as we have more than once indicated.

II. Some are by nature inherent in certain acts. For an example,
take him who coming from the enemy, or from strangem, gives him-
sels into the hands of another people or king. For that such a per-
son tacitly binds himself not to do anything against that state in which
he secks refuge, cannot be doubted. Wherefore they are not to be
followed, who say that the act of Zopyrus was free from blame: for
his fidelity to his king does not excuse his perfidy towards those to
whom he fled. The same must be said of Sextum the same of Tar-
quin who went over to Gabii. Virgil speaks of Sinon's treachery and
crime.
