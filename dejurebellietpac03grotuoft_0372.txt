362 DE FIDE PUBLICA QUA BELLUM, ETC‘. [LIB. III.

toris veteri contractui, non derelictioni imputatur, nisi certae
conjecturae aliam interpretationem exprimant: ut si quis luere
cum vellet, impeditus id silentio transmisisset tanto tempore,

quod ad consensus conjecturam sufficere possit.

 

is to be ascribed to the old contract, not to derelict3 except well-
founded conjectures point to another interpretation: as if when any
one wished to resume the pledge, and was prevented, he had passed
it over for so long a time as to give room for a presumption of con·
sent.
