IV. Sicut autem res domino reddendae sunt, eita et po-
puli et partes populorum his qui jus imperii habuerant, aut etiam
sibi, si sui fuerant juris ante vim injustam. Ita Sutrium re-

anything for himself (v, 23): but from the property restored (for
those are the goods spoken of) he gave a tenth to God, he deducted
the expenses of the young men, and requested a portion to be given
to his allies.

IV. As property is to be restored to its owner, so too are peoples
and parts of peoples to be restored to those who had rightful autho-
rity over them3 or to themselves, if they had been their own masters,
before the unjust violence. Thus Sutrium was recovered and restored
to the allies, at the time of Camillus. The Eginetans and Melians
were restored to their cities by the Lacedaemonians: the Greek citios
which had been invaded by the Macedonians were restored to liberty
by Flaminius. And the same general, in his conference with the am-
bassadors of Antiochus, urged that is was just that the cities in Asia
which were of the Grecian racc, and which Antiochus had recovered,
should be made free3 for that Greek colonies were not sent into AEolia
and Ionia to be slaves to the kiny, but to extend tlte racc, and to diffuse

over tlte earth the Greek station.

V. A question is sometimes raised, concerning the length of time
by which the internal obligation of restoring a thing may be extin-

to be determined by their own laws: (provided such laws recognize
