396 DE FIDE PRIVATA IN BEL-Lo. [Lm. 111.

Nam et hoc fieri posse jam scierat, eum promitteret. Sic et
de decem captivis, ut quidem ex antiquis scriptoribus rem nar-
rat Gellius, octo postliminium justum non esse sibi respon-
derunt, quoniam ει(ῐεῇῑινὶο vincti forent.

VII. 1 Solent et promittere quidam ne in certum locum
redeant, ne adversus eum, qui ipsos in potestate habet, mili-
tent. Prioris exemplum apud Thucydidem, ubi sic Ithomen-
ses promittunt Lacedaemoniis, exituros se Peloponneso, nec
unquam redituros. Posterius nunc frequens est. Vetus ex-
emplum est apud Polybium, ubi dimittuntur ab Amilcare
Numidae sub lege, μηὸένα φέρειν ὅπλον πολέμιον κατ’
αὐτῶν· ηε adversus C'artlzayinienses eorum quisquam arma
hostilia ferret. Simile pactum habet in Gothicis bProcopius.

2 Hoc pactum quidam irritum pronuntiant, quia sit con-
tra officium, quod patriae debeatur. At non, quicquid contra
officium est, statim et irritum est, ut et alibi et supra diximus
Deinde vero ne contra officium quidem, libertatem sibi parere

to the teu prisoners, as Gellius tells the story out of old authors3
Eiyht said that they had no rigyht to postliminium, sor they lead by their
oatlzs lost tlzc character of citisens.

VII. 1 Also prisoners often promise not to return to a certain
place, or not to bear arms against him who has them in his power.
We have an example of the former case iu Tliucydide53 when the
Ithomians promise the Lacedaemonians that they will quit Peloponne-
sus, and never return. The latter kind of engagement is now common.
lVe have an old example in Polybius, when the Numidians are dis-
missed by Amilcar, on condition of never bearing arms against the
Carthaginians. Procopius in his Gothic history has a similar pact.

2 Some moralists pronounce this pact void, because it is against
the duty which a person owes to his country. But what is against
duty, is not necessarily and of course void3 as we have already ex-
plained. And in the next place, it is not against duty to obtain one’s
liberty by promising that which is already in the enemy's power. For
the cause of the country is not worsened by such an act3 for he who
is a captive has eeased to be of any value to that cause.

VIII. Also some promise not to make their escape. They are
bound by this promise, even though they were under restraint when
