CAP. XVIII] PRIVATIM FIUNT. 301

vitae aut rerum adeat periculum, quo eventu ea erunt obser-
vanda quae de concesso tuendi se modo alibi diximus. Solet
et conjungi auctoritas publica cum privata utilitate: ut si quis
magno ab hostibus damno affectus impetret jus ex rebus hos-
tium damna sarciendi: quod jus definiendum est ex iis quae
de pignorationibus supra a nobis sunt tradita.

VI, At si quis miles aut alius, etiam in bello justo, aedi-
ficia hostium incenderit, agros vastaverit, atque id genus dede-
rit damna, non jussus, adde cum neque necessitas subesset,
neque justa causa, teneri eum ad sarcienda damna recte a
theologis est proditum. Merito autem addidi, quod ab illis
omissum est, si justa eausa non subsit: nam ea si adsit, tene-
bitur forte suae civitati, cujus leges transgressus cst3 non
item hosti cui nullam fecit injuriam. Non dissimile est quod
Carthaginiensis quidam Romanis Annibalem dedi postulantibus
respondebat: ozon privato publicove consilio Sayzmtum op-
puynatum sit, quaerendum censeo .· secl utrum jure an in-
juria? nostra enim hcee qaeestio atque animadversio in
civem nostrum est, nostro an suo feeerit arbitrio .- vobiscum
una disceptatio est, licueritne per fedus fieri.

κοιναῖς α’τυχίαις προσόδῳ τῇ μεγίστῃ bens quam communes calamitates. (Va.
χρησάμενος· pleraque horum ea* ique Crass. init. pag. 543 B.)
belloque rapuit, nihil maqis luero Ιια-

one's self. Also public authority is often eonjoined with private
utility ; as if any one, having suffered some great loss from the enemy,
should obtain authorization to reimburse himself out of the encmy's
property: and the right, in this case, is to be defined by what we
have said above of pissnoration.

VI. But if any one, soldier or other, even in a just war, sets fire
to buildings of the enemy, wastes the land, and inflicts damage of that
kind, without orders, and we must add, when there is neither any
existing necessity nor any just cause, he is bound to make good the
damage, as is rightly laid down by theologians. But Ι have, for good
reason, added a condition omitted by them, Is there be not any just
cazise5 for if there be such a cause, he may perhaps be responsible to
his own state whose laws he has violated, but not to tho enemy to
whom he has done no wrong. On this, hear what a Carthaginian
replied to the Romans, when they asked to have Annibal given up
to them: thether Sayantam was taken by public or by private act,
is 'not the point, bat whether it was taken riyhtfally ον wronyfally.
The question between us and ozor citizen is, whether he acted by his own
motion or by oar· direction .· the question between yon and us is, whether
wh ιι tusis done was lattfitl under ozor convention with you.
