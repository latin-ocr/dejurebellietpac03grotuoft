modo ¹Josephus exponit, Romanis haud dubie blandiens; sicut
et in expositione praecepti alterius, de non nominandis gentium
diis: quod ille ita explicat quasi illis obloqui vetarentur, cum
revera honoris causa aut sine abominatione eos nominare lex
non sineret. Sciebant quippe Hebraei Dei certissimo monitu
in simulacris illis non habitare, aut Dei spiritum, aut bonos
angelos, aut vim astrorum, ut deceptae gentes existimabant,
sed pravos et humano generi infestos daemonas: ita ut recte
dixerit Tacitus in J udaeorum institutis describendis, profana
illis omnia quce apud nos sacra. Non mirum ergo est, si

Sic et Xerxes cum simulacra Graecorum corrupit, nihil fecit
contra jus gentium, etsi multum id ad invidiam exaggerant
Graeci scriptores. Nam mPersae non credebant in simulacris
esse ulla numina, sed Deum esse Solem, et portionem ejus
aliquam ignem. Lege Hebraea, ut idem Tacitus recte, tem-

defeat the superstition of the Gentiles, being warned that there was
defilement in the very touch of them3 not as if they spared the
sacred objects of other nations, as «Iosephus expounds the fact ; no
doubt speaking with a view to gain favour with the Romans: as he
does also in the explanation of another precept, the prohibition of
naming the gods of the Gentiles: which he explains as if they were
forbidden to speak evil of them; whereas in reality the law did not
permit Jews to speak of them with honour or without abomination.
For the Hebrews kneW, by the undoubted instruction of God, that
these idols were not occupied either by the Spirit of God, or by
good angels, or by asti-al influences, as the misguided heathen
thought, but by evil demons, the enemies of the human race: as
Tacitus said rightly in describing the institutions of the Jews; All
thinys are profane to them which are sacred to us. Thus when
Xerxes destroyed the images of the Greeks, he did nothing contrary
to the laws of nations‚ although the Greek writers greatly exaggerate
his acts for the sake of throwing odium upon him. For the Persians
did not believe that there was any divinity in idols, but that the Sun
was God, and that fire was a portion of him.
