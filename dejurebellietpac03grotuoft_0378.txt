minutos: for that is the natural way. The cessation by civil days
comes from laW, or the customs of peoples. In the other case, it is
often a doubt, whether the day or month or year to which the truce
was to last is excluded or included in the truce.

2 Certainly iu natural things there are two kinds of boundary;
the one, within the thing, as the skin is the boundary of the body: the
other without the thing, as a river is the boundary of the land. And
so, boundaries which are made by the will of man, may be settled
either the one way or the other. But it seems more natural, that a
boundary should be taken which is a part of the thing: a terminus is
ihc last part of a thing, as Aristotle says: nor is use against this. The
