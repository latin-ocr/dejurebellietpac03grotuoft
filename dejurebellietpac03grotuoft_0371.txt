sunt efficere, ut in principalium interpretatione a regula rece-
datur: ejus autem naturam et ipsa sequi debent.

LVIII. Obiter hoc addendum est, obsides interdum non
accessionem esse obligationis, sed revera partem principalem ε
ut cum quis ex contractu factum promittit non suum, et quia,
eo non praestito, tenetur ad id quod interest, ejus vice obsides
obligantur: quam fuisse videri sententiam Caudinae sponsionis
diximus alibi. Non dura tantum, sed et iniqua est sententia
existimantium, obsides etiam sine consensu suo alterum ex
facto alterius posse obligari.

LIX. Pignora quaedam communia habent cum obsidibus,
quaedam propria. Commune, quod et ex alio jam debito re-
tinentur, nisi obstet data fides: proprium, quod quae de iis
est pactio, non tam stricte sumitur, quam illa de obsidibus:
neque enim aequale est odium. Res enim natae sunt, ut te-
neantur, non et homines.

LX. Illud alibi quoque diximus, nullum tempus id effl-
cere posse, ne luitio sit pignoris, si id praestetur, pro quo pig-
nus suppositum est. Nam qui actus causam veterem et notam
habet, non creditur ox nova procedere. Ideo patientia debi-

LVIII. This however may be added in passing: that sometimes
the hostages are not an accessory part of the obligation, but really a
principal part; as when any one, by contract, promises something to
be done by another3 and, that not being performed is held to the
amount of interest involved in the agreement 3 then his hostages are
bound in his place3 which was the doctrine held in the Caudine con-
vention, as we have elsewhere stated. The opinion of those who hold
that hostages are bound sor one anothcr's acts, even without their own
consent, is hard and unjust.

LIX. Pledges have some points in common with hostages, some,
peculiar. It is common to the two, that being given for one thing,
they may be retained for another, except a stipulation to the contrary
have been made. And it is peculial· to Pledges, that the covenant
which is made concerning them, is not to be taken so strictly as that
concerning hostages: for things are made, to be held as property;
men are not.

LX. We have also said elsewhere, that no period of time can
supersede the obligation of restoring the pledge, if that be done to
secure which the pledge was deposited, For an act which has an old
and known cause is not to be believed to come from a new one.
Thcrefore tho forbearance of the debtor [who deposited the pledge]
