78 DE JURE INTERFICIENDI HOSTES IN [L1n.111.

mist-⁵23³· sunt: quare mirum non est, si, quod Baldus notat, multo plus

ammam. licentiae sit in bello quam in pignorandi jure. Et hoc quidem
quod dixi in peregrinis, qui commisso cognitoque bello intra
fines hosticos veniunt, dubitationem non habet.

VII. At qui ante bellum eo iverant, videntur jure gen-
tium pro hostibus haberi kpost modicum tempus intra quod

'rhum-26· discedere potuerant. Nam sic Epidamnum obsessuri Corcy-
raei peregrinis primum discedendi faciebant copiam, denuntiantes
alioqui pro hostibus futuros.

VIII. 1 Qui autem vere subditi sunt hostium, ex causa
scilicet permanente, eos offendere ubique locorum jure hoc
gentium licet, si ipsorum personam respicimus. Nam cum
alicui bellum indicitur, simul indicitur ejus populi hominibus,
ut supra ostendimus in formula indictionis: sic et in decreto,

Liv. xxxi. 8. vellem, juberent Philippo reyi Macedonibusque qui sub reyno
ejus essent bellum indici. Hostis autem qui est, ubique secun-
sstpert-tragr- dum jus gentium impeti potest. Euripides:
7a9.v.3o.3.
Νόμος γὰρ ἐχθρὸν δρᾷν ὅπου λάβῃς κακῶς.
Ubicumque prensum jura ltedi hostem sinunt.

that of secui-ities, which, as we have said, were introduced after the
example of burthens imposed to pay the debts of the state3 wherefore
it is not to be wondered at that much more is allowable in war than
in the law of securities. And this is not a matter of doubt as con-
cerns strangers who enter the enemy's confines when war has been
begun and is known.

VII. But those who had gone thither before the war, may, it
would seem, by the law of nations, be held for enemiesrafter a mode-
rate time within which they could depart. And thus the Corcymans,
when about to besiege Epidamnus, first gave allowance to strangers
to depart, and announced that if they did not, they would hold them
for enemies.

VIII. 1 As to those who are truly the subJects of the enemy,
that is, from a permanent cause, it is allowable to attack them where·
ever they are, by this right of nations, if we regard their persons.
For when war is declared against any one, it is declared against the
men of that people‚ as we shewed above3 and so in the decree
against Philip. And he who is an enemy may be attacked every-
where, as Euripides says. So Marcion of deserters.
