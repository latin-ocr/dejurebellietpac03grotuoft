380 DE FIDE MANENTE BELLO, [Lm. 111.

XXVI. Et potest idem pluribus debere pretium, si ab
uno dimissus, pretio nondum soluto, eaptus sit ab alio: sunt

enim diversa haec debita ex diversis causis.
XXVII. Conventio de pretio facta rescindi non potest,

eo quod captus intelligatur locupletior quam credebatur: quia

jure gentium externo, de quo quaerimus, nemo cogitur sup-
plere quod in contractu minus aequo pretio promisit, si dolus
non intercessit: ut intelligi potest ex his quae de contractibus

supra a nobis explicata sunt.
XXVIII. Ex eo, quod diximus captivos nostros servos

non esse, sequitur cessare illam acquisitionem universalem,
quam accessionem esse dominii in personam diximus alibi.

Non alia ergo captori acquirentur quam quae specialiter appre-
henderit: quare si quid clam secum habet captivus, non erit
acquisitum, quia nee possessum. Sicut Paulus jurisconsultus
eontra Brutum et Manilium respondit, qui fundum possessione
cepit, thesaurum, quem in fundo esse neseiat, non cepisse:
quia qui nescit nequeat possidere. Cui consequens est, ut res
eo modo celata ad redemtionis pretium solvendum prodesse

possit, quasi retento dominio.

XXVI. And the same person may owe the amount of ransom
to more persons than one, if, when he has been let go by one, and
the price is not yet paid, he is captured by another: for these are
different debts from different causes.

XXVII. The agreement coneerning the amount of ransom, can«
not be rescinded on account of the prisoner being discovered to be
richer than he was supposed to be3 because, by the external Law of
Nations, which is the subject of our present enquiry, no one is com-
pelled to give more than he promised in a contraet, at a price different
from the current price, if there has been no deecit: as may be under-
stood from what we have said about Contracts.

XXVIII. From what we have said, that prisoners with us are not
slaves, it follows that there is an end of that acquisition of a right
over all that belongs to the person, as well as the person ; for that this
is a mere accessory to the power over the person, we have elsewhere
said. Therefore nothing else becomes the property of the captor,
but what he specially takes possession of. And therefore, if the
prisoner has anything secretcd with him, that is not acquired by the
captor, because it was never in his possession. So Paulus the jurist
gave his opinion against Brutus and Manilius, that he who came into
possession of a piece of land, did not acquire possession of a treasure
which he did not know to be there3 because not knowing of it, hc
