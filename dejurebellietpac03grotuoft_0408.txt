398 DE FIDE PRIVATA IN BELLO. [Lm. 111.

ut ii de decem captivis, qui redire nollent, datis custodibus ad
Hannibalem deducerentur.

XI. De interpretatione tenendae regulae jam aliquoties
memoratae, ut a proprietate verborum non recedatur, nisi ab·
surdi vitandi causa, aut ex alia satis certa mentis conjectura:
ut in dubio magis interpretemur verba contra eum, qui legem
dedit.

XII. Vitam pactus non etiam ad libertatem jus habet.
Vestium nomine arma non veniunt: sunt enim haec diversa.
Venisse auxilium recte dicitur si sit in conspectu, etiamsi nihil
agat: nam ipsa praesentia suam vim habet.

XIII. At rediisse ad hostem non dicetur qui clam rediit
ut statim exiret: rediisse enim ita intelligendi debet, ut in
potestate hostium iterum sit. Contraria interpretatio vetera-

us, had written, that many of tho senators were of opinion, that those

Hannibal under guard.

XI. With regard to Interpretation, the rules are to be observed
in this case also, which we have several times mentioned3 that we are
not to recede srom the propriety of the words, except in order to
avoid an absurdity, or for some other good probable reason: that in
a doubtful caso we are rather to interpret the words against him who
gave the law: and the like.

XII. He who has covenanted for his life, has not a right to his
liberty also. Under the name of clothes, arms are not included: for
they are different in kind. Aid is said to have arrived, if it be in
sight, though it be doing nothing3 for the presence of it has an
efficacy.

XIII. But he cannot be said to have returned to the enemy ac-
cording to his promise, who returned seeretly in order to go away
again immediately: for he was to be understood to mean by return,
that he was again to be in the power of the enemy. The contrary
quibbling interpretation is called by Cicero silly cunning, involving
fraud and perjury. And this interpretation is called by Gellius a
fraudulenta cunning3 and those who had employed it were noted as
ignominious by the censor, and made incapable of giving evidence,
and disreputable.

XIV. Whon an agreement is made for surrendering a city except
