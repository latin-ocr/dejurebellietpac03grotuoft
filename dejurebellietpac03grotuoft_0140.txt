130 DE JURE AOQUIRENDI BELLO CAPTA. [L1B.111.

Quae principibus eximiae datae
Erant Achivis:

Et de Andromacha (ibid. vers. 274):

Καὶ τήνδ’ Ἀχιλλέως ἔλαχε παῖς ἐξαίρετον.
Accepit illam Pyrrhus eximiam sibi.

Ascanius de equo apud Virgilium (AEfn. 1x. 270, 271):

Ipsum illum clypeum, cristasque rubentes
Excipiam sorti.

Pausaniae post in Plataeis praelium eximia data, mulieres,
equos, camelos, narrat Herodotus. Sic Ocrisiam Cornicula-
nam praecipuam accepit rex Tullius. dFabricius apud Hali-
carnassensem in oratione ad Pyrrhum: ἐκείνων ὃορυκτῆτων

ἐξόν μοι λαβεῖν ὁπόσα βουλοίμην· ex his quoe bello erant
capta licebat mihi quantum vellem excipere. Isidorus huc
respiciens ubi de jure agit militari: proedoe, ait, decisio, et
pro personarum qualitatibus ac laboribus justa divisio, ac
principis portio. Tarquinius Superbus, ut apud Livium est,
et ipse ditari volebat, et delinire praeda popularium animos.
Servilius in oratione pro L. Paulo ait eum praeda partienda

times awarded to others on account of their vaiour. So Euripides
in the Troade& speaking of the noblest of tho Trojan women, says,
that they were given to the leaders of the army. And of Andro-
mache, that in this way she became the property of Pyrrhus. So
Ascanius says, in Virgil, that the shield and the helmet he will ex-
clude from the division by lot. Herodotus tells us that after the bat-
tle at Plataea, Pausanias had, given to him, the most eminent objects,
women, horses and carneis. So king Tullius received Ocrisia, the prin-
cipal person of the Corniculanae. Fabricius in Dionysius, in his oration
to Pyrrhus, says, Of those tlzinys which were taken in war, it was
allowed me to take what I chose. Isidorus, referring to this passage,
when he speaks of military laW, says, the distribution os the spoil is, α
just division according] to the qualities and performances of persons, and
the prinee’s portion. Tarquin the Proud, as it stands in Livy, both
wished to enrich himself and to win the minds of the people with
the distribution of prize-money. Servilius in his oration for L. Pau-
lus, says that he might have made himself rich by dividing the
shares of booty *. And there are writers who think that the prince's

allowed to make the division. J. B.
