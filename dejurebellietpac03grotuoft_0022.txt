not been able to find in history‘ anything on the subject as deter-
mined by Instituted LaW. When the Romans carried provisions to
the enemies of the Carthaginians, they were sometimes taken prisoners
by the Carthaginians, and then given up by the Carthaginians to the
Romans on being demanded. When Demetrius held Attica with an
army, and had taken Eleusis and Rhamnus, neighbouring towns, in-

permit the subjects of an enemy to traffic in their country, nor should assist the
enemy with soldiers, ships or provisions. And afterwards, in 1627, a convention
was made between the kings of Sweden and of Denmark, to the effect that the
Danes should prevent all commerce with the Dantzickers, the enemies of the
Swede53 and should not allow any merchandize to pass the Sound, to the other
enemies of the Swedes3 for which terms the king of Denmark stipulated in turn
certain advantages to himself.

But these were special eonventions, from which nothing can be inferred which
is binding upon all. For what the Germans said in their declarations was, not
that all merchandize was prohibited by this convention, but that only which was
once carried to England or made iu England. Nor were the Germans the only
party who refused to acknowledge the doctrines of the English, forbidding com-
merce with their enemy. For Poland complained by her ambassador that the
Laws of Nations were infringed, when, on account of the English war with Spain,
they were deprived of the power of trafficking with the Spanish; as Camden and
Reidan mention under the year 1597. And the French, after the peace of Vervins
with Spain, when Elizabeth of England persisted in the war, being requested by
the English to allow their ships going to Spain to be visited, that they might not
privily carry munitions of war, would not permit this3 saying that the request‚ if
granted, would be made a pretext for spoliation and disturbance of commerce.

And in the league which the English made with the Hollanders and their allies
in the year 1625, a convention was indeed made, that other nations, whose interest
it was that the power of Spain should be broken, should be requested to forbid
commerce with Spain; but if they would not agree to this, that their ships should
be searohed. to see whether they carried munitioris of war; but that beyond this,
neither the ships nor the cargo should be detained, nor that any damage should be
done to neutrals on that ground. And in the same year it happened, that certain
Hamburghers went to Spain in a ship laden for the most part with munitions of
war3 and this part of the lading was claimed by the English3 but the rest of the
