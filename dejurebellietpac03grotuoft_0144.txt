134 DE JURE AoQUIRENDI BELLO CAPTA. [Lm. ΙΙΙ.

eveniat, hut qui segnior sit praedetur, at fortissimus quisque
laboris periculique praecipuam partem petere soleat, quae sunt
Lib. v.20. verba Appii apud Livium: unde non longe abit Cyri illud
¹24 cyri-{nst apud Xenophontem: ἐν τῇ ἁρπαγῇ εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι οἱ πονηροὶ
Χὲζυῗί EivJ πλεονεκτήσειαν ἄν. Sed contra dicitur, gratius id fore lae-
umfflpr' tius-que qnod sua quisque manu ex hoste captum domum retu-
lisset, quam si multiplex accepisset alterius arbitrio.

posset. In expugnatione Cortuosae Hetruscorum oppidi, nar-

ducis voluntatem.

aut pecuniam e praeda redactam concedi solere, id ferme ita
contigit, ut his qui tributum ad bellum contulerant tantundem

in pillage, are so forward as to snatch the prizes which ought to fall
to the share of the bravest3 for it commonly happens that they who
are slowest in fight are quickest in plunder, while the bravest soldiers
commonly take the main share of danger and toil3 as Appius says in
Livy. And so in Xenophon. On the other hand it is said that what
each takes from the enemy with his own hand and carries home, is
more grateful and valued than a thing of many times the value,
which he receives at the will of another.

3 Sometimes again, pillage is allowed, when it cannot be pre·
vented. In the storming of Cortuosa, a town of the Hetrusci, Livy
says, The Tribmzes directed that tlte booty should be public property‚· but
tlte command was too slowfor the intention. The soldiers had already
taken the booty, and it could not be taken from them without doing] a
very oclious tlzz‘nq. So the camp of the Gallo-Graecians was plundered
by the troops of O. Helvius contrary to the general's wish.

XIX. What I have said, that booty or prize-money is sometimes
given to others than soldiers, generally happens, in order that those
who have contributed to the expenses of the war should be remune-
rated3 we may also sometimes read of public spectacles provided out
of the spoils.
