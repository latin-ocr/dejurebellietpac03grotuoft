326 DE FIDE PUBLIOA QUA BELLUM FINITUR, [Lm. 111.

protrahi, nec ad angustias nimias arctari debet, sed ita intel-
ligi ut valeat quod probabili ratione nititur. Plane aliud erit
si quis rex simul subditorum dominus sit, neque tam civile
quam familiare imperium acceperit: ut qui bello victos in ser-
vitutem redigunt: aut si in personam quidem dominium non
habeat, sed in res habeat, ut Pharao in terra AEgypti ex emto,
et alii qui advenas in suum privatum receperunt. Nam hie
jus praeter regium accedens efficit ut ex eo consistat, quod alio-
qui per se solo regio jure consistere non posset.

VII. 1 Disputari et hoc solet, quid in res singulorum
possint pacis causa statuere, qui reges sunt, nec in res subdi-
torum aliud jus habent quam regium. Alibi diximus sres sub-
ditorum sub eminenti dominio esse civitatis, ita ut civitas, aut
qui civitatis vice fungitur, iis rebus uti, easque etiam perdere
et alienare possit, non tantum ex summa necessitate, quae pri-
vatis quoque jus aliquod in aliena concedit, sed ob publicam
utilitatem, cui privatas cedere illi ipsi voluisse censendi sunt,
qui in civilem ccetum coierunt.

lated by fair reasons. It is plainly another matter, if the king be the
absolute master of his subjects, and have received a domestic rather
than civil authority3 as in the case of those who reduce a conquered
people to slavery3 or if, without having such dominion over their
persons, they have it over their goods3 as Pharaoh king of Egypt, by
purchase; and other& who have received new comers into their pri-
vate property. For here, another kind of right, added to the regal
rights, produces a result which the regal rights of themselves could
not produce.

VII. 1 This is also a common question3 what may be done for
the sake of peace, with the goods of individuals, by kings who have
no other right over the property of subjects than the regal right.
We have elsewhere said, that the property of subjects is under the
eminent dominion of the state; so that the state, or he who acts for
it, may use, aud even alienate and destroy such property3 not only in
case of extreme necessity, in which even private persons have a
right over the property of others3 but for ends of public utility, to
which ends those who founded civil society must be supposed to
have intended that private ends should give way.

2 But it is to be added, that when this is done, the state is
