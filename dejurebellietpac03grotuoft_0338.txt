causis quae aut dominio insunt suapte natura, aut ex domino-
rum facto ortum habent.

X. Sed haec inspectio, ne nisi ex publica utilitate res
privatorum concedantur, regem spectat et subditos, ut illa de
damno sarciendo civitatem et singulos. Nam externis, qui
cum rege contrahunt, sufficit factum regis, non tantum ob
praesumtionem quam secum adfert dignitas personae, verum

Lib· iii-¹1· etiam ob gentium jus, quod bona subditorum obligari ex facto
regis patitur.

XI. 1 Circa interpretandas pacis conventiones observan-

{Jissi'lff' dum est quod supra a nobis est traditum, quo quidque plus

habet favoris, eo laxius accipiendum3 quo longius abit, eo
restrictius. Si jus naturae merum spectamus, maximus favor
in eo esse videtur ut suum quisque consequatur, quod Graeci
dicunt ἕκαστον ἔχειν τά ἑαυτοῦ, et proinde videtur ambigue
positorum interpretatio eo ducenda, ut qui justa arma habuit
id consequatur ob quae arma sumsit, et damna sumtusque
recuperet: non item ut poenae nomine quicquam lucretur, id
enim est odiosius.

arises, has always its effects by Natural Law3 in so far that it cannot
be taken away, except either from causes which belong to the very
nature of ownership, or arise out of the act of the owners.

X. But this consideration, that the property of private parties is
not to be given up, except on the ground of public utility, regards the
king and his subjects3 the other consideration, respecting compensa-
tion for loss, regards the state and individuals. For as regards stran-
gers who contract with the king, the act of the king is sufficient3 not
only on account of the presumption of due authority which the dignity
of the person implies 3 but also from the Law of Nations, which allows
the goods of subjects to be bound by the act of the king.

XI. 1 With regard to the interpretation of conventions of peace,
we must observe what has been delivered above that3 in proportion
as any condition is more favourable, it is to be taken more loosely:
in proportion as it is the contrary, more restrictedly. If we regard
mere Natural LaW, the most favourable condition seems to be, that
each shall obtain his own: and therefore the interpretation of doubt-
ful expressions is to be drawn to that sense3 that he who has taken
up arms justly, shall obtain that for which he went to war, and recover
his losses and expense53 but not that he shall obtain anything under
the plea of penalty; for that is more odious.
