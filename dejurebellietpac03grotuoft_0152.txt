142 DE JURE ACQUIRENDI BELLO CAPTA. [Lm. ΙΙΙ.

quem pars praedae dimidia cedebat phis qui in procinctu fue-
rant. Sic et Alexandri miles praedam privatis ereptam suam
faciebat, nisi quod eximia quaedam solitus esset ad regem
referre: unde accusatos eos videmus qui ad Arbela conspi-
rasse dicebantur, de praeda omni ita sibi vindicanda, ut nihil

in aerarium deferrent.

4 At quae publica hostium aut regis fuerant, exemta
erant huic lieentiae. Ita legimus Macedonas, cum Darii castra·
ad Pyramum amnem irrupissent, ingens auri argentique pon-
dus diripuisse, nec quicquam reliquisse intactum qpraeter regis
tabernaculum: tradito more, inquit Curtius, ut victorem victi
reyz's tabernaculo eccciperem. Unde non abit mos Hebrae-
orum, qui victi regis coronam regi imponebant victori, eidem-
que assignabant (quod in Thalmudicis Digestis legitur) regiam
supellectilem bello captam: et quod in rebus gestis Caroli
Magni legimus, cum is Hungaros vicisset, privatas opes mi-
liti, regias aerario cessisse. At apud Graecos λάφυρα erant
publica, ut ante ostendimus, σκῦλα singulorum. Vocant autem
σκῦλα ea quae durante certamine eripiuntur hosti, λάφυρα

people, among whom half of the spoil went to those who were in
service in the army. Thus also the soldiers of Alexander had for
their use the booty taken from private persons, except that there was
a custom of transferring to the king any objectos peculiar value3
and accordingly, we find that those who were said to have conspired
at Arbela, were accused of intending to appropriate the whole of the
spoil, and to give nothing to the treasury.

4 But what had been with the enemy, public property or king’s
property, was exemptcd from this licence. Thus we read that the
Macedonians, when they stormed the camp of Darius at the river
Pyramus, plundered a great mass of gold and silver, and left nothing
untouched except the king’s tent: ccccordz'ny to the established usaye,
says Curtius, that the conquerecl party should receive the conqueror in
the lciny’s tent. And the usage· of the Hebrews was not different, who
put the crown of the conquered king on the head of the conqueror,
and assigned to him (as we read in the Talmudic Collections) the
royal furniture which was taken in the war. So, in the history of
Chai-lemagne, we read that when he had conquered the Hungarians,
the private treasure went to the soldiers, the royal, to the treasury.
Among the Greeks there were two different words for public and
private spoil, λάφυρα and σκῦλα. The latter implies what was taken
