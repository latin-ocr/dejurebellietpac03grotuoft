hanc sententiam ex facto consultus respondit aGregorius Neo-

recepissent.

’ 2 The answer which was given by illustrious jurists, rcspecting a
slave who, captured by robbers, had afterwards made his way to the
enemy, [and was then captured from them, and exposed for sale.
Gronov] namely‚ that it was truc, that he had been stolen, and that
his having been in the hands of the enemy, or having returned by
postliminium, was no obstacle to that view3 is the same answer which
we must give respecting him who, being captured in an unjust war,
afterwards by just war, or in any other way, comes into the possession
of another: for in internal justice, an unjust war does not differ from
a robbery. And to this effect responded Gregory of Neocesarea,
being consulted in reference to the case, when certain men of Pontus
had received into their possession property of the citizens captured
by barbarians.

it was taken: and we see that this has often been done. Livy, after
