CAr. XXI] UBI DE INDUCIIS, OOMMEATU, ETO. 377

XIX. Expresso comitum nomine non sunt intelligendi
hi, quorum causa magis est odiosa, quam ipsius cui prospici-
tur. Tales sunt piratae, latrones, transfugae, desertores.
Gentis expressum nomen in comitibus, satis ostendit facultatem
ad alios non porrigi.
XX. Jus commeandi cum veniat ex vi potestatis, in
dubio non exstinguitur morte concedentis, seeundum ea quae
alibi diximus de regum et aliorum imperantium beneficiis {asp-1114?-
XXI. Disputari solet de eo, quod dictum est in hunc ‘il' ’
modum, quamdiu voluero. Et verior est sententia eorum,
qui existimant durare beneficium tale, etiam si novus volendi
actus non intercedat, quia durare in dubio praesumitur‚ quod
ad juris effectum sufficit3 ⁰non etiam ubi is, qui concessit,

desiit posse velle, quod per mortem contingit. Persona enim cammon-

in such a grant, but only such as you usually take on ajourney.

XIX. If companions be expressed, those are not to be under-
stood, whose case is more odious than the person himself to whom
the grant is made. Such are pirates, robbers, deserters, refugees.
The expression of the name of the nation of the companions per-
mitted, shews sufficiently that the permission does not extend to
others.

XX. The right of Safe Passage, since it proceeds from the force
of power, in a dubious case is not extinguished by the death of the
grantor 3 as wo have said elsewhere of grants made by kings and
other governors.

XXI. Disputes often arise on the point of grants made with the
expression, As long] ας [shall think· proper. And theirs is the soundcr
opinion, who hold that such a grant continues, even if a new act of
willing do not intervene3 because in a dubious case, that is presumed
to continue to operate, which is necessary to the effect of right3 but
this is not so, when he who made the grant has ceased to be able to
will, as happens by death. For the person being taken away, that
presumption of duration falls to the ground along with it, as an acci-
dent ends with the substance.
