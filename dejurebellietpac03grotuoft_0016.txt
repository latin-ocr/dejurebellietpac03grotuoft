6 QUANTUM IN BELLO LICEAT, [L1ss.111.

[mn-11. c. alibi notavimus. Et tamen ille ipse Deus, hominum suo jure

”him dominus, ob paucissimos bonos parcere solet quamvis magnae
malorum universitati, et eo suam, qua judex est, aequitatem
testatam facit, ut Abrahami cum Deo colloquium de Sodomis
aperte nos docet. Et ex his quidem generalibus regulis cog-
nosci potest quantum in hostem liceat naturaliter.

V. 1 Sed et quaestio incidere solet, quid liceat in eos qui
hostes non sunt, aut dici nolunt, sed hostibus res aliquas sub-
ministrant. Nam et olim et nuper de ea re acriter certatum
scimus, cum alii belli rigorem, alii commerciorum libertatem
defenderent.

2 Primum distinguendum inter res ipsas. Sunt enim quae
in bello tantum usum habent, ut arma: sunt quae in bello nul-
lum habent usum, ut quae voluptati inserviunt: sunt quae et in
bello et extra bellum usum habent, ut pecuniae, commeatus,
cnaveS, et quae navibus adsunt. In primo genere verum est

have elsewhere explained. And even God himself, who is the supreme
Lord of men, often spares the whole body, though large, for the sake
of a few good men3 and thus manifests his equity as a judge 3 as the
dialogue of God with Abraham concerning Sodom plainly shews.

From these general rules we may see what is lawful against an
enemy by Natural Law.

V. 1 But the question often arises, what is lawful against those
who are not enemies, or will not allow themselves to be so called, but
who provide our enemies with supplies of various kinds. This has
been a point sharply contested, both anciently and recently3 one
party defending the rigorous rights of war, the other, the freedom of
commerce.

2 In the first place, we must make a distinction as to the things
supplied. For there are some articles of supply which are useful in
war only, as arms; others which are of no use in war, but are only
luxuries3 others which are useful both in war, and out of war, as
money, provisions, ships and their furniture. In matters of the
first kind, that is true which Amalasuintha said to J ustinian, that they
are of the party of the enemy who supply him with what is neces-
