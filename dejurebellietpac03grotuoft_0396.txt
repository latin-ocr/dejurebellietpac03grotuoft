386 DE FIDE MINORUM POTESTATUM [Lm. 111.

bitur: quod si proscriptum quidem sit, sed non pateat, tenetur
qui praeposuit: conditio quoque praepositionis servanda est:
nam si quis sub certa lege vel interventu cujusdam personae
contrahi voluit, aequissimum erit id servari, in quo praepositus
est.

2 Cui consequens est, ut alii reges aut populi magis, alii
minus ex ducum suorum contractibus teneri possint, si satis
notae sint ipsorum leges atque instituta. De his si non constat,
sequendum est quod conjectura dictat, ut concessum intelligar-
tur id, sine quo satis commode, quae officii sunt, expediri non
possunt.

3 Mandati fines si excesserit minor potestas, tenebitur
ipsa, si quod promisit praestare non potest, ad aestimationem:
nisi lex aliqua satis cognita id quoque impediat. Quod si
dolus accesserit, id cst, si pra> se tulerit jus majus quam habe-
bat, jam tenebitur et de damno culpa dato, imo et ex crimine
ad poenam crimini respondentem. Ex priore causa bona obli-
gantur, et si ea deficiant operae, aut libertas corporis: ex
posteriore quoque persona, aut bona, aut utrumque, pro de-

 

 

of the Principal. But if notice were given, and were not publicly
known, the Principal is bound. Also the condition of the agency is
to be obscrvcd3 for if the Principal directed the contract to be made
on certain mles, or by the intervention of a certain person, it is just
that the contraet should be valid on these conditions.

2 From which it follows, that some kings and peoples may be more,
and others less bound, by the contracts of their generals, if their laws
and rulcs are sufficiently known. If these are not commonly known,
the interpretation must be followed which conjecture dictates3 in
such a way that that· is understood to be conceded without which
the functions which belong to a person’s duty cannot be conveniently
carried out.

3 If a subordinate authority has excecded the bounds of his com-
mission,l1e will be bound, if he cannot perform what it has promised,
to an estimated equivalent: except some law sufficicntly known pre-
vent that also. But if deecit be added, that is, if he prctended to an
authority greater than he had, he will then be bound, both for the
damage done by his fault, and as a criminah to the penalty corre-
sponding to his guilt. On the first ground, his goods are liable, and
if they are insufficient, his labour, or his personal liberty: on the
second ground, his person also is liable, or his goods, or both, accord-
ing to the quantity of the transgression. What we have said of deecit,
will hold, even if the person so acting made an attestation that he did
not intend himself to bear the obligation3 because the debt due for
