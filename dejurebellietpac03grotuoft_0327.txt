sequi: lex legi non miscetur: eundum est qua ducimur. J us
gentium ista discrimina non agnoscit, ubi scilicet alia juris sui
obtinendi spes non est.

XVII. Idem dicendum erit si qui promissum urget non
contraxerit, sed damnum dederit. qSeneca ibidem: colonum
suum uon tenet, quamvis tabellis manentibus, qui seyetem
ejus proculcavit, qm· succidit arbusta, non quia recepit quod
pepiyerat, sed quia ne reciperetur effecit. Mox alia addit
exempla: pecus abegyisti servum ejus occidisti. rDeinde:
licet me comparare inter se quantum profuerit mihi quisque,
aut quamam nocuerit, et tum pronuntiare, utrum plus de-
beatur mihi, an debeam.

XVIII. Postremo et quod ex poena debetur ei, quod
promissum est, potest contribui, quod eodem loco late expli-
catur: et beneficio qratia debetur, et injurioe ultio .· nec eqo cap. ⁵.
qratiam illi debeo, uec ille mihi poenam: alter ab altero
absolvimur.- mox: Scomparatione facta inter se beneficii et
injurice, videbo an etiam ultra mihi debeatur.

follow. We must go the way the law points. But the Law of
Nations does not acknowledge those distinctions, that is, when there is
no other hope of getting our own.

XVII. The same must be said, if he who urges our promise has
not made a contract with us, but has infiicted a damage upon us.
So Seneca, in the same place, The laudowner is not to have the riyht
Qf bindiny the farmer to him, eveu {f the ayreement be uncaucelled, if he
trample down his corn, {f he cut down the plants; not because he has
received what he aqreed for, but because he has himself been the means cf
his not receiving] ic. And he adds other examples : Ycu have driven off
his cattle, you have killed his slave. And then: Let me compare what
benefic any oue has produced me, and what harnz, and then pronouuce
whether more is owinq to me erfrom me.

XVIII. Finally, that which is due as penalty may be balanced
against that which has been promised, which is explained at length in
the same place, thus: Bencfit demands recompense, injury, satisfactiowz ,-
where both occur, I neither owe him recompense, nor hc me satisfactiou.
We are quibs with one another. Balancins] the benefic and the injzcry, I
shall see whether anythiny more is due to me.
