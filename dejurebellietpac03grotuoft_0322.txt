berii Gracchi, cum Octavio tribunatum abrogavit, dicens tri-
bunitiam potestatem a populo habere sanctimoniam, non ad-
versus populum. Ergo, ut diximus, jurejurando et civitas et
rex obstringi poterunt, etiam in causa subditorum.

IX. Sed et tertio, qui metum non intulit, promissio va-
lide fiet: nec scrutabimur quid aut quatenus ejus intersit,
quae juris Romani sunt subtilitates: natura enim omnium ho-
minum interest ut hominibus aliis consulatur. Sic Philippo,

X. Sed ct, quemadmodum probavimus alibi, status mix-

mixtum transiri pactis potest: ita ut subditi qui fuerant, inci-

the case of subjects.

IX. But also, in such a case, a valid promise may be made to a
third person, who has not imposed fcar. Nor, so fur as this rule is con-
cerned, shall we inquire closely what are the subtilties of the Roman
law. For by nature, it is the interest of all men, that regard should be
had to other men besides the parties. Thus when Philip made peace
with the Romans, hc was deprived of the power of punishing the
Macedonians, who had rcvolted from him.

X. But also, since we have proved elsewhere, that mixed states
sometimes exist3 as we may pass from one pure state to another, so
we may pass into a mixed state by compacts3 so that they who had
been subjects, may begin to have the supreme authority, or at least
a part of it3 and even with the liberty of defending that part by
force.

XI. 1 A regular war, that is, one, on both sides public and
declax-ed, as it has other peculiaritics which exist in external rights, so
has it this3 that what is promised in the course of such a war, or for
the purpose of ending it, is of such validity, that it cannot be rendered
void by the allegation of sear unjustly impressed, contrary to the will
of the promiser. For as many other things, although not free from
