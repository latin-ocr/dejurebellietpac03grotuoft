176 DE PesTLIMiNio. [Lm. 111.

recipiant libertatem, si forte eos vis sociorum eximat hostili
imperio. At si ipsa multitudo-quae civitatem constituerat dis-
soluta sit, verius puto non eundem populum censeri, nec post-
liminio res restitui ipso gentium jure, quia populus, ut navis,
partium dissolutione plane interit, eo quod tota ejus natura in
illa perpetua conjunctione consistit. Non ergo quae fuerat
Sagunti civitas eadem exstitit, cum veteribus cultoribus ea
sedes octavo post anno restituta est: neque Thebae, cum jam
Thebani in servitutem ab Alexandro veniissent. Hinc appa-
ret quod Thessali Thebanis debuerant, non esse Thebanis
postliminio restitutum: idque duplici de causa: tum quod
novus erat populus, tum quod Alexander, quo tempore domi-
nus erat, hoc jus alienare potuerat et alienaverat, et quia
creditum non in eorum est numero quae postliminio redeunt.

2 Ei quod de civitate diximus haud multum dissimile est
quod veteri illo Romano jure, quo dissolubilia erant conjugia,
qmatrimonium non censebatur postliminio restitui, sed novo
consensu redintegrari,

happen that the force of their friends extricate them from the power
of their cnemies. But if the multitude which had constituted the
state or city be dissolved, I conceive it to bc more true that it is not to
be reckoned the same people, and that their condition is not restored
by postliminium, by the law of nations ε for a people, like a ship, by the
dissolution of its parts, perishes outright3 since its whole nature con-
sists in the continuity of its composition. And therefore that which
had been the city of Saguntum was no longer the same city, when the
same place was restored to the old inhabitants eight years later: nor
was Thebes the same city when the Thebans had been sold as slaves
by Alexander. Hence it appears that what the Thessalians owed the
Thebans was not restored to the Thebans by postliminium, and that,
sor two reasons: because it was a new people; and because Alexander
could and did alienate this right3 and because a credit is not of the
number of the things which return by postliminium.

2 What we have said of a city, is not dissimilar from the old
Roman law, accordIng to which, marriages being dissolvable, the mar-
