Ι. 1 UAE diximus hactenus pleraque ad eos pertinent, qui

aut summum in bello arbitrium habent, aut publica
imperia exequuntur. Videndum etiam quid privatim in bello
liceat, qua naturae, qua divino, qua gentium jure. Narrat
officiorum primo Cicero Pompilii imperatoris exercitu militasse
Catonis Censorii filium, sed mox dimissam legionem in qua is
militabat: cum nihilominus adolescens amore pugnandi in
exercitu remansisset, Catonem scripsisse ad Pompilium, ut si
eum vellet remanere in exercitu, secundo cum sacramento
militiae obligaret, addita causa, quia priore amisso, jure cum
hostibus pugnare non poterat. Addit et ipsa Catonis ad filium
verba ex epistola, quibus eum monet ut caveat ne praelium

CHAPTER XVIII. Os' acts donc by Privato Pers-ons in cc¹ Public W'ur.

Ι. 1 What we have hitherto said, pertains, sor the most part, to
those who either have the supreme authority in war, or hold public
offices. We must now consider what is lawful for private persons,
according respectively to Natural LaW, Divine Law, and the Law of
Nations.

Cicero relates that Cato's son served in thc army of Pompilius
till his legion was dismissed: that he then remained with the army
as a volunteer: and that Cato wrote to Pompilius, that if he wanted
to keep him in the army, he must make him take the military oath
agaim because the former oath being cancelled, he could not law-
fully fight with the enemy. He adds also the very words of Cato's
letter to his son, warning him not to take part in the fighting. So
we read that Chrysas, a soldier of Cyrus, was praised, because, when
he had raised his swerd to cut down an enemy, he lowered it on
hearing the signal for a retreat. So Seneca.
