174 DE POSTLIMINIO. [Lm. 111.

Parrhasius emerat. Quaerit enim cum decretum factum esset
ab Atheniensibus quo Olynthii juberentur liberi esse, hoc 40011-
tineretur liberi ut fierent, an ut liberi judicarentur3 quorum
hoc est verius.

VI. 1 Liber autem homo, postquam ad suos rediit, non
se tantum sibi acquirit, sed et res omnes quas habuerat apud
populos pacatos, sive corporales, sive incorporales. Quia po-
puli pacati, sicut factum pro jure secuti erant in capto, ita
et in liberato, ut se aequos praebeant utrique parti. „ Ergo
dominium quod habuerat in res ejus is, qui belli jure eum
possidebat, non erat sine omni conditione: cessare enim po-
terat ipso invito, si captus qui fuerat ad suos pervenisset.
Has ergo res sic ille perdit, quomodo hominem cujus erant
accessio.

2 Quid si tamen alienasset? an qui titulum habet ab eo
qui belli jure eo tempore erat dominus, tutus erit gentium
jure, an et haec recuperabuntur? de his loquor quae apud
populum belli medium exstabant. Distinguendum videtur inter
res, quae ejus sunt generis ut postliminio redeant, et qnae

noted by Florentinus. The same follows if he be spontaneously given
up by the enemy.

But what is the result if he be sold by the enemy in the usual
way of traffic, and so come to his own people? This controversy is
treated by Quintilian, with reference to the Olynthian, whom Parrha-
sius had bought. For a deeree having been made by the Athenians
that the Olynthians should be free, he enquires whether this means
that they should become free, 01· should be adjudged to be free: of
which the latter is the more true opinion.

VI. 1 Moreover a free man, after he has returned to his own
people, acquires, not only himself, but all the property which he had
in a neutral State, both corporeal and incorporeal. For the neutral
State, as they took the fact for law in the ease of eaptivity, must do
the same in the ease of liberation, to show themselves impartial to
both parties. Therefore the right, which he who possessed him by
the law of war, had over his property, was not altogether without con-
ditions: it was liable to cease without his consent, if he who had been
captive made his way to his own people. He therefore loses the pro-
perty, as he loses the man to whom it was an accessary.

2 But what if he had alienated this property? Will he who de-
rives his title from him who, at the time, was owner, by the right of
war, be safe by the law of nations 3 or may the property be recovered
