68 DE BELLA JUSTO SIVE SOLENNI JURE [LIB. ΙΙΙ.

praedones, neque in eo quod rex gerit in subditos locum
habent. Ideo Seneca distincte dixit: indicta bella finitimis,

aut qesta cum civibus.
XII. Nam quod notant quidam et exemplis docent,

etiam in bellis talibus capta fieri capientium, verum est, sed
ex una dumtaxat parte, idque ex jure naturali, non ex jure
voluntario gentium, ut quod gentibus tantum prospicit, non his
qui sine gente sunt, aut pars gentis. Errant et in e0, quod
putant bellum sui tuendi aut rerum tuendarum ergo suscep-
tum indictione non egere: nam eget omnino: non quidem
simpliciter, sed ad eos quos dicere coepimus, et mox explicabi-

mus, effectus

XIII. Ne illud quidem verum, non statim atque indic-
tum est inferri bellurn posse: quod Cyrus in Armenios, Ro-
mani in Carthaginienses, ut modo diximus, fecerunt. Nam
indictio nullum post se tempus jure gentium requirit. Potest
tamen fieri, ut ex naturali jure tempus aliquod requiratur ex
negotii qualitate, puta cum res repetitae sunt, aut poena in
nocentem postulata, et id negatum non est. Tunc enim id

the two peoples or their heads: for from this public character arise
peculiar effects, which do not take place either in a war carried on
against pirates, ‘or in one which a king makes against his subjectS.
And so Seneca speaks with a distinction, of war declared ayainst ozeiyh-
ὂοιινε, or carried οη assainst om· own citizens.

XII. For what some remark and illustrate by examples, that
even in such wars, what is captured becomes the property of the cap-
tersis true, but on one side only, and that by Natural LaW, not by
the instituted Law of Nations; since that regards only nations and
their dealings with nations, not those who are without nation, or are
only part of a nation. They err in this, that they think that a war
undertaken for the purpose of defending one’s self or one’s property,
does not need to be preceded by a declaration of war3 for it by
all means needs such an introduction: not indeed simpl—y, but for
the sake of leading to the effects we have already partly explained, and

shall explain further.
XIII. Nor is it true even that a war may not be begun immedi-

ately after it has been declared: which Cyrus did in Armenia, and
the Romans towards the Carthaginians, as we have already said. For
a declaration of war does not, by the Law of Nations, require any
definite time after it. But it may be requisito that, by Natural
LaW, some time may be required, in consequence of the quality of
the business: as for instance, if property is required to be restored,
