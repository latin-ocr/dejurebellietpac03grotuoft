aut de commodo discedant: de qua aequitate itidem a nobis

injustitia excusari non possunt, qui, cum pacta improbent,

tamen retinent quod sine pactis non haberent: ut cum senatus

IV. 1 Illud quoque ex supra a nobis dictis repetendum gig-iffi&
est, obligari eum qui praeposuit, etiam si praepositus feeit con-
tra mandata arcana, intra limites tamen publicae functionis.
Hanc aequitatem recte secutus est praetor Romanus in insti-
toria actione: neque enim omne, quod eum institore geritur,
obligat eum, qui praeposuit, sed ita, si ejus rei gratia cui prae- L-⁶¹⁶1'¹²²‘²²²⁴1·

what was done, and allowed it to be done 3 and in this ease, if no other
reason [besides consent] can be probably assigned, we have elsewhere
stated what course the matter must take. The superior authority are
obliged by the thing itself to this extent; that they are not to be
made better off by the loss of other persons3 that is, that they are
either to fulfil the contract by which they wish to obtain an advantage,
or are to give up the advantage3 a case of equity which we have
elsewhere discussed. And so far, and no further, acts which are
performed so as to bring utility to uS, are to be said to be valid. On
the other hand, they cannot be excused from the charge of injustice,
who, while they condemn the compaet, retain that which without the
compact they would not have: as when the Roman Senate neither
could approve the act of Cn. Domitius, nor would rescind it: of which
kind of occurrence we have many in history.

IV. 1 We must also repeat what we have said before, that he
who placed a person in a command, is bound, even though the person
so placed acts against secret orders3 at least, within the limits of his
public function. This rule of equity was rightly followed by the
Roman Praetor, in the action against an Agent3 for it is not everything
done by the Agent which obliges the Principal, but such things only as
are contracted in the matter for which his agency was employed ; but
he concerning whom public notice was given, that conti-acts with him
would not be held good by the Principal, does not stand in the place
