146 DE JURE ACQUIRENDI BELLO OAPTA. [Lm. 111.

capta, addicendam rem ei cui favent leges aut mores populi
a cujus partibus res capta est: quod si ejus nihil probetur,
ex jure gentium communi rem ipsi populo adjudicandam, si
modo ea res in actu bellico capta est. Nam ex his quae dicta
jam ante a nobis sunt satis apparet non omnino verum esse id
quod pro Thebanis adfert Quintilianus3 in eo quod in judi-
cium deduci potest nihil valere jus belli, nec armis erepta
nisi armis posse retineri.

XXVI. 1 Quae vero res hostium non sunt, uetsi apud
hostes reperiantur, capientium non fiunt: id enim, ut jam
ante diximus, nec naturali juri congruit, nec jure gentium
introductum est. Sic Romani Prusiae dicunt: '‘si is ayer Αη-
tiochi ηοη fecisset, eo ne populi quidem Romani factum
apparere. Si quod tamen in illis rebus jus habuit hostis
quod possessioni connectatur, puta pignoris, retentionis, servi-
tutis, id quo minus capientibus acquiratur nihil obstat.

‘are to be adjudged to those to whom they belong by the laws and

customs of the people by whose party the capture is made. And if
there is no proof on this point, then, by the common Laws of Nations,
the thing is to be adjudged to the nation itself, provided it be taken
in war. For from what we have said, it appears that the assertion
of Quintilian is not exactly true, pleading for the Theban53 that in
a matter which can be brought into a court of justice, the right of
war goes for nothing 3 and that which is taken by arms can only be
kept by arms.

XXVI. 1 Things which do not belong to the enemy, though
they are found with the enemy, do not belong to the capt0r53 for
that, as we have said, is neither congruous to natural law nor esta-
blished by the Laws of N ations. So the Romans say to Prusias, If
the land had not belonyecl to Antiochus, it would thence follow that
it did not become tlte property os tlte Romans. But if the enemy
had any right over these objects, such as is connected with posses-
sion3 as a right of pledge, retention, servitude, there is no reason
why that should not pass to the captors.

2 This also is often made a question, whether things taken out-
sidc the territory of both belligerents become the property of the
captors3 which is controverted, both with regard to persons and
things. If we regard only the Laws of Nations, I think the place is
not to be considered3 as we have said, that an enemy may be lawfully
