ΟΑΡ. XIX] DE FIDE INTER HOSTES. 315

‘non poterat absolutio, respectui puerorum data est. Cato in
Oriyinibus scripserat, nisi pueris et lacrymis usus esset, poenas
eum daturum fuisse.

XIV. Sed simul sciendum est, duobus modis fieri posse
ut quis a perfidia vacet, nec tamen id faciat quod promissum
est, defectu scilicet conditionis, et per compensationem. De-
fectu conditionis non vere liberatur promissor, sed eventus
ostendit nullam esse obligationem, ut quse non nisi sub condi-
tione contracta erat. Et huc referendus casuS, si prior alter
non implerit quod ex sua parte implere tenebatur. Nam
unius ejusdemque contractus capita singula alia aliis inesse
videntur per modum conditionis, quasi expressum esset, haec
ita faciam si et alter faciat quae promisit. Ideo Tullus Alba-
” nis respondens, Deos testes facit, uter prius populus res re-
petentes leyatos aspernatus dimiserit, ut in eum omnes expe-
tant clades belli. Non tenebitur pro socio, ait Ulpianus, qui
ideo renunciavit, quia conditio quaedam qua societas erat
inita ei ηοη proestatur. Hanc ob causam quoties alia mens
est, solet diserte poni, ut si· contra hanc aut illam partem
quid fiat, cetera non eo minus rata maneant.

XIV. But at the same time it is to be remarked, that there are
two ways in which the promiser may be blameless of perfidy, though
he does not perform what he had promised3 namely, by defect of the
condition, and by compensation.

By defeet of condition, the promiser is not truly liberated from a
promise, but the event shews that there was no obligation, since it was
conti-acted only under the condition. And to this head is to be
referred the case in which the other party has not fulfilled what, on
his part, he was bound to fulfil. For in a contract of that kind, each
article implies the others in the way of condition3 as if it had been
expressed by saying, I will do so and so if the other does what he has
promised. So Tullus, answering the Albans, says that he calls the
gods to witness that, Whichever people slzall first reject ancl dismiss the
ambassadors who come and asle sor restitation, οη it slzall fall all the
calamities of tlte war. Ulpian says, He is not to be held as an ally who
renoanced the treaty because some condition οη which the alliance was
ayreed to was not pewformed. On this account, if the intention of the
treaty be different from this, it is usually clearly expressed, that if
anything be done contrary to this or that part, the other parts still
remain valid.
