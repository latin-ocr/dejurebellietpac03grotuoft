mitting transit, in supplying provisions, in not helping persons besieged.
The Corcyreans say, that it is the duty of the Athenians, if they will
be neutral, either to prevent the Corinthians from raising soldiers in
Attica, or to allow them to do so. To Philip king of the Macedonians
it was objected, that the league was doubly violated by him: inasmueh
as he had done injury to the allies of the Romans, and helped their
enemies. The same is urged by T. Quinctius, in his eonferenee with
Nabis.

2 In Agathias, we read, that he is an enemy, who does what the
enemy wishes: and in Procopius, that he is reekoned to be in the
army of the enemy, who helps the enemy’s army in matters which are
properly of military use. So Demosthenes had said before. M. Acilius,
in speaking to the Epirotes, who were aeeused of sending money to
Antiochus, says that he does not know whether he is to regard them
as enemies or neutrals. L. Emilius, Pretor, condemns the Teians, be-
cause they had supplied the enemy’s fleet with provisions, and had
promised it wine ς adding, that except they did the same to the Roman
fleet, he should hold them as enemies. So Augustus said that A city
lost tlte rz‘sflzts of peace when it received αη enemy.
