nations, to make known both the justice of the cause, and also the
probable hope of exacting their rights.

[The note of Grotius respecting the cases in which the rights of
belligerents against neutrals had then been enforced is so important,
that I will give the substance of it below. Ι may observe that the rules
which ho has here laid down agree with the Rulcs of Intcrnational

Italian, and contains the constitutions of the Emperors of Greece and Germany, the
kings of the Franks, of Spain, Cyprus, the Balearic 1s1es, of the Venetiam, and of the
Genoese. In Title 274 of this book, controversies of this kind are treated; and the
rule given is this, that if the ships and the lading both belong to the enemy, the
matter is plain, and they become the property of the captorS. If the ship belong
to a neutral, the goods to an enemy, the belligerent may compel the ship to go into
a port of his own, paying the navigators for the freight. If, on the other hand, it
is an enemy's ship, with the goods of a neutral, the ship is to be ransomed, and if
the navigators refuse this, they may be taken into a port of the captors, and the
captor must be paid for the use of the ship.

In the year 1438, when the Hollanders were at war with Lubeck and other
cities on the Baltic and the Elbe, they decided in full Senate, that goods of neutrals
found in the enemy's ships were not good prize, and that law was afterwards main-
tained. So also in 1597, the king of Denmarkjndged‚ when he sent an embassy to
the Hollanders, and their allies, asserting for his subjects the right of carrying
goods into Spain, with which the Hollanders were then in fierce war. The French
always permitted neutrals the right of carrying on commercc with those who were
the enemies of France3 and so indiscreetly, that their enemies often covered their
goods with neutra] names3 as appears by an edict of 1543, chap. 42, which was
copied again in an edict of 1584, and the following year. In those edicts, it is
plainly declared that the friends of the French shall be allowed to carry on com-
merce during war, provided that they do it with their own ships and their own
men 3 and that they may land where they please, provided the goods are not muni-
tions of war 3 but if these are carried, it is declared to be lawful for the French to
