“In Bede's works Englishmen can go back to anginas os their history, unequalled sor
form and matter by any modern European nation. Pros. Mayor has done good service in ren-
dering a part of Bede's greatest work accessible to those who can read Latin with ease. He
has adorned this edition os the third and fourth books of the ‘ Ecclesiastical History' with that
amnzing erudition sor which he is unrivalled among Englishmen and rarely equalled by Cermans.
And however interesting and valuable the text may be, we can certainly apply to his notes
the expression, La sance vaut mieux que le poisson. They are literally crammed with interest—
ing information about early English lise. For though ecclesiastical in name, Bede's history treats
of all parts os the national lise, since the Church had points of contact with all.''—Examz'ner.

Fenow and Tutor of Gonvme and Caius College. New edition. 3s. 60¹.

“Mr Reid has decidedly attained his aim, namely, ‘a thorongh examination of the Latinity
of the dialogue.' . . . . . The revision os the text is most valuable, and comprehends sundry
acute corrections. . , . This volume, like Mr Reid’s other editions, is a solid gain to the scholar-
ship os the country.”-Atl1enaeum.

“A more distinct gain to scholarship is Mr Reid’s ablewand thorough edition of the De
Amicitia of Cicero, a work of which, whether we regard the exhaustive introduction or the
instructive and most suggestive cominentary, it would be difficult to speak too highly. . . . When
we come to the commemary, we are only amazed by its fulness in proportion to its bulk.
Nothing 1s overlooked which can tend to enlarge the learner's general knowledge of Ciceronian
Latin or to elucidate the text. ”—Saturdar Review.
