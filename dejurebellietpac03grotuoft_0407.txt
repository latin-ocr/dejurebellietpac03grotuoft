CAP. XXIII] DE FIDE PRIVATA IN BELLO. 397

deterior fit patriae causa, cui is, qui captus est, ni liberetur,
jam periisse censendus est.

VIII. Promittunt et nonnulli non fugere: tenet hoc eos,
etiamsi vincti promiserint, contra quam quidam sentiunt. Nam
et sie solet aut vita servari, aut mitior obtineri custodia. Si
vero vinetus sit postea, ita demum liber erit, si ideo promi-
serit, ne vinciretur.

IX. Satis inepte quaeritur, an, qui eaptus est, alii dedere
se possit. Nimis enim certum est, neminem sua pactione jus
alteri quaesitum adimere posse. Est autem captori jus quae-
situm, aut ipso belli jure, aut partim belli jure, partim eon-
cessu ejus qui bellum gerit, secundum ea quae supra expo· {2¹³3 ieijssseqq

X. Circa effectus pactorum egregia quaestio est, an pri-
vati, si in fide praestanda negligentes sint, a suis potestatibus
eogendi sint eam implere. Et cogendos verius est in bello
duntaxat solenni, ob jus gentium, quo bellum gerentes obstrin-
guntur alter alteri jus reddere, etiam de factis privatorum, ut
puta si a privatis violati essent hostium legati. Sic Cornelius

they promised3 contrary to the opinion of some moralists. For in this
way, mcn's lives are saved, and their captivity made less harsh. If,
however, a person, having made such a promise, is afterwards put in
chains, he will be liberated from his promise, if he made it to avoid
being put in chains.

IX. A question is raised, idly enough, whether he who is captured
can surrender himself to another than the captor. For it is abund-
antly certain that no one ean by a eompact of his take away a right
from another. And the captor has already acquired a right, either by
the right of war, or partly by the right of war, partly by the eonces-
sion ot' the superior authority which makes the war3 as we have ex-
plained above.

X. With regard to the effeets of compacts, there is a noted
question, whether private persons, if they are negligent in fulfilling
their engagements, can be compelled by their own authorities. And
the sounder opinion is, that they are compellable only in a regular
war, on account of the Law of Nations, by which the belligerents are
bound to fulfil the rules of justice to each other, even with regard to
the acts of private persons3 as for instance, if ambassadors had been
