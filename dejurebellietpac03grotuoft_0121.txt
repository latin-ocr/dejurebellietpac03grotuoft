c.x1‘.V1.] DE JURE ACQUIRENDI BELLO CAPTA. 111

ΙΙΙ. 1 Ceterum in hac belli quaestione placuit gentibuS, ut
cepisse rem is intelligatur, qui ita detinet, ut recuperandi spem
probabilem alter amiserit, aut ut res persecutionem effugerit,
ut loquitur in simili quaestione Pomponius. Hoc autem in‘513424321231153¹
rebus mobilibus ita procedit, ut capta dicantur ubi intra fines, ’
id est, praesidia hostium perducta fuerint. Eodem enim modo L 19 §³- D-
res amittitur, quo postliminio redit. Redit autem ubi intrau 351²· i‘sitd
fines lmperii esse coepit, quod alibi explicatur intra praesidia. Ilio-⁵ §1 d
Imo et aperte Paulus de homine dixit, amitti eum ubi fines
nostros excessit: et Pomponius captum bello explicat eum,
quem hostes ex nostris ceperunt, et intra praesidia sua perdux-
erunt: antequam enim in praesidia perducatur hostium, manere
civem.

2 Hominis autem et rei, in hoc gentium jure, eadem fuit
ratio. Unde facile intellectu est quod alibi dicuntur capta sta-
tim capientium fieri cum conditione aliqua, continuandae scilicet In {c ,derel-
eo usque possessionis, debere intelligi. Cui consequens esse ᾖ 431> αἰ

classis se tenet, perducta sunt: nam tunc desperari incipit
recuperatio: sed recentiori jure gentium inter Europaeos po-

 

sidered as captured when they are brought within the boundaries, or
intra praesidia, under the protection of the enemy. A thing is lost in
the same way in which it is recovered by postliminium: and it is
recovered when it comes again within the boundaries of the empire,
which is elsewhere explained as intra praesidia. Indeed Paulus
expressly says of a man, that he is lost when he goes out of our
boundaries3 and Pomponius explains a man taken in war to be
one of ours whom the enemy has taken and brought intra proesz'dia
sua.- and that till then he is a citizen.

2 A man and a thing in this part of the Law of N ations are under
the same rule. Hence it is to be understood that when it is said
that things captured forthwith become the property of the captor-s,
is to be understood with a certain condition, namely‚ that the pos-
session continues till they are thus brought intra praesz'dia. Whence
it seems to follow that at sea, ships and other things captured are
understood to be captured when, and not till, they are brought into
dock or harbour, or to the place where the fleet is3 for then reco-
very becomes desperate. But we find that it has been established
by the more recent law of nations among Europeans that such
things are understood to be captured when they have been twenty·
four hours in the possession of the enemy.
