ΟΛΡ. ΧΙΧ.] DE FIDE INTER HOSTES. 319

subditorum bona pro eo quod civitas debet jure gentium obli-
gata intelligantur, ut alibi diximus.

4 Addamus et hoc, generosi esse animi stare federibus
etiam post aliquid injuriae acceptum: quo nomine sapiens In-
dus Iarchas laudabat regem, qui laesus a vicino federatO, οὑ
παρέλυσε τούς ὅρκους, οὕτω βεβαίως ὀμωμοκέναι φήσας, ὠς
μηδὲ ὁπότε ἠδικεῖτο λυπεῖν αὑτὸν, non discessit α jurata
fide, aiens tam sancte sc jurasse, ut alteri oze post acceptam
quidem injuriam nociturus essct.

5 Quae vero de fide hostibus data incidere solent quaes-
tiones, ferme omnes solvi possunt, si adhibeantur regulae supra
traditae, cum de vi, tum quorumvis promissorum, tum speciali
jurisjurandi, federis ac sponsionum, et de regum jure ac obli-
gatione, deque ambiguis interpretandis dissertavimus. Tamen
ut et antedictorum usus sit manifestior, et si quid praeterea
controversi est discutiatur, specialium quaestionum frequen-
tiores atque illustriores attingere non pigebit.

to stand to agreements, even after an injury has been received3
on which grounds Iarchas, the wise Indian, praised a king who,
having been injured by a neighbour who was under league to him,
did not swerve from the saith which he had sworn, saying that he had
sworn so solemnly that he could not burt the other even after receiving]
the injury.

5 The questions which commonly occur with regard to keeping
saith with enemies‚ may almost all be solved, by applying the rules
given above, concerning the force, both of promises in general, and of
oaths in particular, the effect of conventions and securities, the rights
and obligations of kings, and the interpretation of ambiguities. But
that the use of what has been said may be the more manifest, aud
that, if there be any remaining controversies, they may be discussed,
we shall not hesitate to take the trouble of touching upon the more
frequent and more celebrated of special questions.
