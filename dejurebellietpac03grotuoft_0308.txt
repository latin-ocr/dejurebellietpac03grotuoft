298 DE HIS, QUAE IN BELLO PUBLICO [L113.111.

sisset, causam reddidit: ὅτι βέλτιόν ε’στι τοῦ φονεύειν, ‘ni
πείθεσθαι τῷ ἄρχοντι· quia praejectis parere satius est
quam hostem occidere. Et Plutarchus cur qui militia solutus

Q‘ffssssssn' est occidere hostem non possit causam reddit, quod legibus
militaribus non teneatur quibus teneri debeant pugnaturi. Et

Lib· ii-6· apud Arrianum Epictetus memoratum modo Chrysantae factum
referens τ οὕτω προύργιαίτερον ἔδοξεν αὐτῷ τὸ τοῦ στρατη-
Ὑοῦ πρόσταγμα, ἰ) τὸ ’ἴδιον ποιεῖν· tanto illl potius videbatur
ducis quam suam voluntatem exequi.

3 At jus naturae et internum si respicimus, videtur in
bello justo cuilibet concessum ea facere, quae parti innocenti
intra justum bellandi modum profutura confidit: non etiam
res captas suas facere, quia nihil ipsi debetur: nisi forte poe-
nam justam exigat communi hominum jure. Quod postremum

munao.- quomodo per evangelii legem restrictum sit, ex his quae supra
a nobis tractata sunt, intelligi potest.

rempublicam salvam volunt me sequantur. Imo et singulis

 

about to cut down an enemy, lowered his sword, on hearing the signal
for retreat, gave the reason, It is better to obey α commanding] officcr
than to kill an enemy. And Plutarch gives, as a reason why he who
has left the army cannot lawfully kill an enemy, that he is not bound
by that military law by which persons who engage in battle should
bc bound. And Epictetus, in Arrian, referring to the act of Chrysas
just mentioned, says, So much better did lzc think it to do his officer's will
than his own.

3 But if we look to Natural Law and interna] right 01· justice, it
seems to be conceded, in a just war, to any one, to do any thing, which
he considers will benefit the innocent party, within the just limits of
warfare: but not to make captured property his own, because there
is nothing owing him, except in the case in which he is exacting a
just punishment by the common right of war. Which last, in what
manner it is restricted by the Gospel Law, may be understood by
what has been already said.

4 A mandate of a commanding officer may be either general or
special: general, as in a tumult among the Romans, the Consul said,
Who arc for thc sqfcty of the republic follow me. And sometimes,
even individual subjects have the right given of killing an enemy,
even when not in sels-defense, when it is expedient on public
grounds.

II. 1 Α special command may be given, not only to those who
receive pay, but also to volunteerS, who serve at their own charge, and
