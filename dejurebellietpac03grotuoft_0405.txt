OAP.XXIII.] DE FIDE PRIVATA IN BELLO. 395

temporariis hanc potestatem: sed neque lex hoc semper facit;
parcit enim civibus. neque semper facere potest. nam leges
humanae, ut alibi diximus, vim obligandi tum demum habent, Lib-i 34 3174,
si latae sint ad humanum modum, non si onus injungant, quod. §12' ¹¹ 2
a ratione et natura plane abhorreat. Et ideo leges et prae-
cepta specialia, quae tale quid aperte prae se ferunt, pro legi-
bus haberi non debent3 generales autem leges interpretatione
benigna ita accipiendae sunt, ut casus summae necessitatis ex-
cludant.

4 Quod si aetus, qui lege aut praecepto interdictus erat, et
valere vetitus, interdici aequo jure potuit, jam irritus erit actus
privati, sed puniri tamen idem poterit, ideo quod promisit id,
quod sui juris non erat, maxime si juratus id fecerit.

VI. Promissio captivi de redeundo in carcerem merito
toleratur: neque enim deteriorem reddit captivi conditionem.
Non ergo, ut quidam existimant, gloriose tantum fecit M. At-
tilius Regulus, sed et quod debebat: Requlus, inquit Cicero, offic. iii. 29.

turbare perjurio. Nec obstat illud ε 1333&

porary, their power: but the law does not always do this; for it is
tender of the interests of citizens. For human laws, as we have else·
where said, have then, and then only, a binding force, if they are made
in a humane manner, not if they impose burthens which are repug-
nant to reason and nature. And therefore special laws and precepts
which have, upon the face of them, anything of this kind, are not to be
held as laws: and general laws are to be interpreted indulgently, so
as to exclude cases of extreme necessity.

4 If an act, which was interdicted by a law or precept, and de-
prived of its validity by prohibition, could be interdicted with reason-
able right, the act of the private person will be void 3 but at the same
time he is liablo to punishment for having promised what was not in
his power, and especially if he did it under oath.

VI. The promise of a prisoner to return into captivity is rightly
allowed: for it does not render the condition of the prisoner worse
than it was. And therefore Regulus, in doing what he did, acted not
gloriously only, as some think, but also as he ought. Reyulus, says
Cicero, ouykc not to disturb the conditione and covemmts belonyioiy to the
laws qf war, by om aec osperjury. Nor is it a sound objection, that, as
Horace says, he knew the tortures which awaited him: for when he
gave the promise he knew how likely this was. And so with regard
