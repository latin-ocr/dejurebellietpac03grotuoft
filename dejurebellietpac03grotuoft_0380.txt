actus bellici, sive in personas, sive in res, id est, quicquid vi

fit adversus hostem: id enim omne per induciarum tempus fit

contra jus gentium, ut in concione ad milites loquitur L.
Lib. xl. 27. AEmilius apud Livium.

2 Etiam quae res hostium casu aliquo ad nos pervene-
runt, eae reddendae erunt, etiamsi ante nostrae fuissent: quia,
quod jus externum attinet, ex quo haec dijudicanda sunt, ip-
sorum sunt factae: et hoc est, quod ait Paulus jurisconsultus,

L. 19. §i D. induciarum tempore postliminium non esse, quia postliminium
“mamm requirit, ut antecedat jus bello capiendi: quod per inducias
non est.

acts of war, whether against persons or against things, are unlawfu13
that is, everything that is done against an enemy. Everything of that
kind is, in time of truce, against the Law of Nations3 as L. Emilius
says in his speech to the soldiers in Livy.

2 Even things belonging to the enemy, which have, by any chance,
come into our hands, are to bc restored3 and this, even if they had
previously been curs: because, so far as regards external right, by
which such things are to be judged, they have become theirs. And
this is the purport of what Paulus the jurist says, that in time of
truce, there is nopostliminium3 because postliminium requires that
the right of capture in war should precede3 which, in time of truce,
cannot be.

3 It is lawful to go and return on either side, but with such appa-
ratus only as shews that there is no danger. This is remarked by
Servius upon Virgil, listrtz'qne impune Latini.- where he also relates‚
that when the city was besieged by Tar-quin, and truce was made
between Porsenna and the Romans, when the Circensian games were
celebrated in the city, the leaders of the enemy entered and contested
in a ehariot-race, and were crowned as victors.

VII. To retire into the interior of our own territory, as we read
in Livy that Philip did, is not at variance with a truce3 nor to repair
