cessum. Nam Argivi non fugati ab Othryade, sed nocte Herod-taz
superveniente abierant, victores se rati et id suis renuntiaturi.

Neque Corinthios fugaverant Corcyraei, sed Corinthii, cum Thucyd. i.
feliciter pugnassent, Atheniensium classem validam conspicati, ⁵¹’54'
nullo cum Atheniensibus virium periculo facto, cessim ierant.
Philippus vero Macedo Attali quidem navem a suis desertam
ceperat, at classem nihil minus quam fugaverat. Itaque, ut

Polybius notat, magis pro victore se gerebat, quam victorem 1¹J1i›b'1‹i‘1‘‹'2³'1i›'15
se sentiebat. ' ' '

3 Illa vero, spolia legere, fcadavera ad sepulturam eon-
cedere, praelio iterum lacessere, quae et dictis locis et apud
Livium aliquoties reperias ut signa poni victoriae, per se nihil Lib-xxix-x1·
probant, nisi quatenus cum aliis indiciis valent ad docendam
hostium fugam. Et certe, qui loco cessit, in dubio magis est
ut fugisse credatur. At, ubi victoriae firma argumenta non
sunt, res manet eo loeo quo ante praelium fuit: et aut ad
bellum, aut ad novas pactiones veniendum est.

that in all the three, the parties separated without a real victory. The
Argives, in Herodotus, were not put to ssight by Othryades, but went
away on night coming on, thinking themselves victorious, and carried
that news to their friends. Nor did the Corcyreans in Thucydides
put to flight the Corinthians3 but the Corinthians, when they had car-
ried on the combat successfully, seeing the fleet of the Athenians
approach in force, retreated without trying their strength with it. In
Polybius, Philip of Macedon took indeed the ship of Attalus when it
had been desertcd by its creW, but was very far from having put to
ssight his fleet3 and therefore, as Polybius says, he rather bore himself
as victor, than thought himself victorious.

3 Those proceedings, of collecting the spoils, granting the bodies
of the dead for sepulture, provoking the adversary to renew the battle,
which, in the places just quoted, and in Livy, you sometimes find put
forwards as signs of victory, of themselves prove nothing3 except so far
as they go along with other indications to prove the flight of the
enemy. Certainly he who has left the field may, in a case of doubt, be
supposed to have run away. But when there is no clear proof of
victory, the matter remains in the condition in which it was before
