paritur. Sic qui se aggregant me impetenti, sive socii sive sub-
diti, in se quoque jus tuendi me mihi porrigunt. Sic qui bello
se miscent quod injustum est, praesertim si ipsi id injustum
esse scire possunt ac debent, obligant se ad sumtus et damna
resarcienda, quia culpa damnum dant. Sic qui bello sine pro-
babili ratione suscepto accedunt, ipsi quoque poenae meritum
contrahunt, pro ratione injustitiae quae ipsorum actui inest.

them. So again those who mingle themselves in a war which is un-
just, especially if they may know and ought to know that it is unjust,
become bound to make good the expense and damage, because they
occasion damage with fault. Thus too, those who J'oin in a war un-
dertaken without a plausible reason, incur the desert of punishment,
in proportion to the injustiee which belongs to their act. So Plato
approves a war carried on till those who are ynilty are compelled το

IV. 1 It is to be observed in the third place, that upon the
right of thus acting‚ many conseque-noes follow indireetly and ex-
traneously to the intent of the actor, to which of themselves he would
