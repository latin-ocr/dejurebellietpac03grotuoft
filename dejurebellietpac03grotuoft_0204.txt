1941 MONITA DE HIS, QUAE [Lm. ΙΙΙ.

videbantur, remisimus. Videbantur, ait, quia injustum id
bellum fuerat, ut jam ante agnoverant Samnites.

2 Non dissimile est, quod ex contractu sine dolo inito,
cui inest inaequalitas, jure gentium nascitur facultas quaedam
cogendi eum qui contraxit ad implenda pacta: nec eo tamen
minus, qui plus aequo stipulatus est rem ad aequalitatem redu-
cere ex probi ac pii hominis officio tenetur.

VI. 1 Sed et, qui damnum ipse non dedit, aut sine
omni culpa dedit, sed rem bello injusto captam ab alio penes
se habet, tenetur eam reddere, quia cur alter ea carere debeat
nulla causa subest naturaliter justa, non consensus ipsius, non
malum meritum, non compensatio, Non aliena ab hac re his-
toria est apud Valerium Maximum : populus, inquit, Romanus
cum P. Claudius Camerinos (luctu atque auspiciis suis ccip-
tos sub hasta vendidisset, etsi cerarium pecunia, fines ayris

nites, in Livy, give up what they had taken3 which, they say, seemed
ours by the risyht of war .· seemed, because the war was unjust, as the
Samnites had confesscd.

2 It is a case of the same kind, that an uncqual conti-act, made
without dcccit, gives, by the Law of N ations, a right of compelling the
sulfilment of the compacts 3 and yet he who has the advantage, is bound
by the duty of an honest and pious man, to reduce it to equality.

VI. 1 But also, hc who has not caused any damage, or has
caused it without any fault, but who has in his possession a thing
taken in war from another, is bound to restore it, because there is no
cause, naturally just, why the other should be deprived of it 3 not his
consent3 not his ill desert3 not compensation. There is a story to
this effect in Valerius Maximus: IVlzen P. Claudius had taken and
sold tlte people of Camerina, although the money and the conquest were
very advantaqeous, the Roman peoplc soziqht them out and redeemed them,
because the justice of the proccediny did not seem oleam· and grave them a
divelliny in the Aventine, and restored their property. So, by a decree of
the Romans, the Phocenses had their liberty and land restored. So
the Ligurians who had been sold by M. Popilius, were redeemed and
restored to liberty, and their property given back. So with regard
to the Abderites, the Senate decreed the same thing, adding the reason,
that the war had been unjust.

2 But hc who holds such property, if he have spent anything
upon it, may deduct as much as it was worth to the owner to rccover
