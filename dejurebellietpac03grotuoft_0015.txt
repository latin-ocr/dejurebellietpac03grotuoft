2 Sed sicut antehac monuimus saepe, non semper ex omni
parte licitum est quod juri stricte sumto congruit3 saepe enim
proximi caritas non permittet ut summo jure utamur. Quare
etiam quae extra propositum accidunt, et accidere posse praevi-
dentur, cavenda erunt, nisi multo majus sit bonum quo nostra
aetio tendit, quam malum id quod metuitur, aut nisi in par-i
bono et malo multo major· sit spes boni quam mali metus, quod
prudentiae arbitrandum relinquitur : sed ita ut semper in dubio
ad eam partem quae alteri magis quam sibi consulit, ut tuti-
orem, inclinandum sit. Sinite crescere zizania, inquit opti-
mus magister, ne dum ea evellere vultis, evellatis ec triticum.
Multos occidere et indiscretos, inquit Seneca, incendii et
ruinae potentia est. Doeent nos historiae quam sex-ia poeni-
tentia, Ambrosio monente, talem vindiotae immodestiam Theo-
dosius expiaverit.

2 But as we have often warned the reader, that which is agree-
able to strict right is not always lawsul in all respects: for often
goodwill to our neighbour does not permit use to use rigorous rights.
Wherefore the events which take place extraneously to our intent,
and which we see to be likely, are to be provided against, except
the good to which our action tends be much greater than the evil
which is apprehended3 or except, the good and the evil being equal,
the hope of the good is much greater than the fear of the evil3 a
point which is to be left to the decision of prudence3 with the
cantion that we are always, in a doubtful case, to regard the interest
of others rather than our own, as the safer course. Lec the taras yrow,
says the best of Teachers, lest you pull up the wlzeat with them. So
Seneca says that to cause conflagration and ruin, is to destroy many
without distinction. We learn from history, with how grave a remorse
Theodosius, on Ambrose's admonition, expiated such an unmeasured
course of punishment, [when he had sackcd Thessalonica for a sedi-
tion, A.c. 390. Gronov.]

3 And if God sometimes does something· of this kind, we are not
to draw that into an example for us3 for he has unlimited dominion
over us, but he has not given us such dominion over others, as we
