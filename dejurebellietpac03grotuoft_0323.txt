CAP. XIX] DE FIDE INTER, HOSTES. 313

tuntur adeo sint valida, ut ex causa metus injuste illati, invito
eo cui promissa sunt, in irritum deduci non possint: quia sicut
alia multa quantumvis vitio non carentia ex jure gentium pro
justis habentur, lita et metus qui tali bello utrinque infertur.
Quod ni id placuisset, bellis talibus quae valde sunt frequentia
nec modus, nec finis potuisset imponi: quod tamen fieri inter-
est humani generis. Et hoc potest intelligi jus illud esse bel-
licum quod cum hoste servandum ait Cicero, cui et alibi dic-
tum, hostem in bello jura retinere, scilicet non tantum natu-
ralia, sed et quaedam ex gentium consensu orta.

2 Neque tamen hino sequitur, eum qui tale quid bello
injusto extorsit, salva pietate, salvis viri boni officiis, posse re-
tinere quod accepit, aut etiam cogere alterurn, ut stet pactis
sive juratis sive injuratis. Intus enim et ipsa rei natura id
injustum manet: neque interna haec injustitia actus tolli po-
test, nisi ex novo et vere libero consensu.

XII. Ceterum quod metum dixi haberi pro justo qui
bello solenni infertur, mde eo metu intelligi debet quem jus
gentium non improbat. Nam si stupri inferendi metu extor-

blame in general, are, in such a war, made lawful by the Law of Na-
tions, so among them, is the sear which is in such a war impressed by
each side upon the other. If this were not the acknowledged rule,
such wars, which are very frequent, could neither be moderated nor
ended3 while yet it is the interest of the human race that they should
be so, And this is to be understood to represent the rights of war,
which, Cicero says, are to be kept with enemies; who too says else-
where, that an enemy in war has his rights3 that is, not only natural
rights, but others arising from the agreement of nations.

2 But yet it does not follow from hence, that he who has extorted
such promise in an unjust war can retain what he has received, with
no violence to piety and the duty of a good man: nor even tha-t he
can compel the other to stand by his compacts, made with or without
an oath. For internally, and by the nature of the thing, it remains
unjust; and this intel-nal injustice of the act cannot be taken away,
except by a new and truly free consent.

XII. But when Ι say that the sear which is impressed in a regu-
lar war is held to be just, I must be understood to speak of such sear
as the Law of Nat10ns does not condemn. For if anything be ex-
