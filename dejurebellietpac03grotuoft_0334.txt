V. 1 N unc de rebus pactioni subjectis videamus. Im-
perium aut omne, aut ejus partem reges, quales nunc sunt
plerique, regnum habentes non in patrimonio sed tanquam in
usufructu, paciscendo alienare non valent. Imo antequam
regnum accipiant, quo tempore populus adhuc ipsis superior
est, lege publica tales actus in futurum plane irriti reddi pos-
sunt, ita ut nec ad id, quod interest, obligationem pariant.
Atque id populos voluisse credibile est, ne alioqui si ad id quod
interest salva esset actio contrahenti, subditorum bona pro
debito regis caperentur, ac sic de non alienando imperio vana
esset cautio.

2 Ergo ut imperium toturn valide transeat, populi totius
consensu opus est, qui expediri potest per partium legatos
quos Ordines vocant. Ut pars aliqua imperii valide alienetur
duplici opus est consensu, et corporis, et specialiter ejus partis,
de qua agitur, ut quae invita a corpore cui coaluit avelli ne-

 

So Livy3 Dionysius3 Appiam Pliny. And those who arc bound by
the peace, also may share its advantages.

V. 1 Let us now consider what things may bc the subjects of
convention. The royal authority, or any part of it, cannot be alienated
by convention by kiugs, such as most kings now are, having their
authority not as a patrimony, but as a life estate. Indeed before
they received the royal authority, at which time the people was
superior to them, there might have been a law made to render such
acts invalid in all future time, so that they should not produce any
obligation at all, even for compensation for non-sulfilment. And itis
to be believed that the people intended this; since, if the action was
valid to the contractor for compensation, the goods of the subjecte
might be taken for the debt of the king3 and thus, the provision
against alienating tho royal authority might be defeated.

2 Therefore, that the whole royal authority may pass in a valid
manner, it is necessary to have the consent of the whole people3
which may be effected by the representatives of different classes,
whom they call the Orders or the Estates of the realm. That any
part of the empire may be alienated, there is need for a double
consent3 both of the general body, and of that special part which is
under question 3 since it cannot, without its own good-will, be separated
from the body of which it was a part. But the part itself may
transfer to itsclf the sovereign authority, without the consent of the
