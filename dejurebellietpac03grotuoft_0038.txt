XII. Primum est, etiamsi quid dicatur quod falsam ha-
beat significationem infanti aut amenti, in eo mendacii culpam
non esse. Videtur enim communi omnium hominum sensu

fantibus et amentibus non sit judicii libertas, non potest eis
circa eam libertatem injuria fieri.

qui non decipitur, etiamsi tertius inde falsam hauriat persua-

XII. The first result is, that though any thing be said to an
infant, or a person out of his mind, which has a false signification,
it does not involve the guilt of a lie. The common sense of mankind
permits the thoughtless age of ehildhood to be deluded. So Quin-
tilian. The reason is that they have no liberty of judgment, and
therefore they cannot be wrongcd with regard to such liberty.

XIII. 1 The second remark is, that so long as our speech is
directed to him who is not deceived, it is no lie, although a third
person should thereby imbibo a false persuasion. It is not a lie with
regard to him whom we addmss, because his liberty of judging is not
disturbed, as in the case of those to whom a fable is told, which they
know to bc such, or to whom figurative language is used, or irony, or ,
hyperbole3 which figure, as Seneca says, arrives at the truth by a lie,
and which Quintilian calls an allowable exaggeration. Nor is it a
