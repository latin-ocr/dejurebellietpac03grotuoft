186 DE POSTLIMINIO. [Lm. ΙΙΙ.

hospitium tutum promisissent, satis significat cum· subjicit:
etenim quid inter nos atque eos postliminii opus est, cum et
illi apud nos, et libertatem suam et dominium rerum sua-
rum seque atque apud sc retineant, et eadem nobis apud
eos continyant? quare quod apud Gallum AElium sequitur,
quae nationes in ditione nostra sunt, cum his postlimi-
nium non est, ut recte legit Cujacius, hoc additamento sup-
plendum erit, nec cum his quibuscum fedus amicitiae causa
habemus.

XIX. 1 At nostris temporibus non inter Christianos
tantum, sed et apud plerosque Mahumetistas, jus ut captivi-
tatis extra bellum, ita et postliminii evanuit, sublata utriusque
necessitate ob restitutam vim ejus cognationis, quam inter
homines natura esse voluit.

2 Habere tamen locum poterit vetus illud jus gentium, si
res sit cum gente tam barbara, ut sine indictione aut causa
omnes externos et res eorum hostiliter tractare pro jure ha-
beat. Atque eam in partem, dum haec scribo, judicatum est
in summo auditorio Parisiensi, coctus principe Nicolao Ver-

safe hospitality, by saying, For what need is there of postliminium in
such α case ; since they retain their liberty and ownership in our territory
equally as in their own ; and we in theirs? Wherefore what follows in
Gallus AElius: With the nations which cere under our azethority, thero is
no postliminium, is to be understood with the addition, nor with those
with whom we have a league of friendship.

XIX. 1 In our own time, not only among Christians, but also
among most Mahonietan nationS, the right, both of making prisoners
out of war-time, and tho right of postliminium, have vanished3 the
necessity of both having disappeared, by the restoration of that rela-
tionship which nature intended to exist among men.

2 But that ancient Law of Nations may have place, if we have to
do with a nation so barbarous, that it is accustomed, without cause or
declaration, to treat all foreigners and their property in a hostile
manner.

And at the very tIme that I am writing, a judgment to this effect
is given in the High Court of Paris, under the presidency of N icolas
Verdun: that goods which had belonged to French citizens, and had
been taken by the Algerincs, who are accustomed to send sea-rovers,
and to attack all nations, had changed their owner by the right of war:
