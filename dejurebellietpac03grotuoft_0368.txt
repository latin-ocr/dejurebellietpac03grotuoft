358 DE FIDE PUBLIOA QUA BELLUM FINITUR, [Lm. ΙΙΙ.

LI. Sed sunt tamen et deditiones conditionatae, quae aut
singulis consulunt 8, ut quibus vita salva, aut corporum libertas,
aut et quaedam bona excipiuntur3 aut etiam universitati:
quarum nonnullae etiam mixtum quoddam imperium possunt
inducere, de quo egimus alibi.

LII. Accessiones pactionum sunt obsides et pignora.
mObsides diximus dari aut sua voluntate, aut ejus qui imperium
habet: nam in summo civili imperio comprehenditur et jus in
actiones subditorum, ut in bona. Sed civitas aut ejus rector
tenebitur illud incommodum ei, qui patitur, aut proximis re-
pensare3 et si plures sint, quorum quis obses erat, reipublicae
nihil intersit, danda opera videtur, ut sorte res dirimatur. In
vasallum, nisi idem subditus sit, jus hoc feudi dominus non
habet: neque enim reverentia et obsequium, quae debet, huc
usque pertingunt.

LIII. Interfici obsidem posse diximus per jus gentium
externum3 non etiam interno jure, nisi par ipsius culpa acce-
dat. Servi quoque non fiunt: imo et jure gentium bona

LI. There are also conditional surrenders, which secure the
interests of individuals3 so that their lives, or libel-ties, or goods, are
excepted3 or of the whole body; and some such conventions may
even give rise to a mixed authority between the partiesg of which we
have elsewhere spoken.

LII. Hostages and Pledges are accessories to conventions. Hos-
tagcs, as we have said, are given either by their own will, or the will
of him who has authority over them. For in a supreme civil sove-
reignty, is comprehended a right over the actions of subjeets, as well as
their goods, But the state, oi· its ruler, will be bound to make compen-
Sation for the inconvenience to the person who suffers, or Lis near
relations. And if there are several persons, among whom it makes no
difference to the state which is the hostage, it appears proper that the
matter should be settled by lot. A vassaL except he be a subject also,
is not liable to such a right on the part of the seignior: for the
reverence and obedience which he owes his lord do not go so far as
this.

LIII. The putting to death a hostage is, as we have said, lawful
by the external Law of Nations3 but not by interna] rightness, except
there be a corresponding crime on his side. Also hostages do not
become slaves: but on the contrary, by the Law of N ations they can
