CAP. IL] SUBDITORUM PRO DEBITO, ETC. 43

debet praestare civilis aliqua societas, aut ejus caput, sive per
se primo, sive quod alieno debito jus non reddendo se quoque
obstrinxerit, pro eo teneantur et obligata sint bona omnia
corporalia et incorporalia eorum qui tali societati aut capiti
subsunt. Expressit autem hoc quaedam necessitas, quod alioqui
magna daretur injuriis faciendis licentia, cum bona imperan-
tium saepe non tam facile possint in manus venire, quam pri-
vatorum qui plures sunt. vEst igitur hoc inter jura illa quae

account or as bound for another, all the goods, corporeal and incorpo-
real, of the members of the society, are bound and liable. And this
rule has been established by a certain necessity, in that otherwise
there would be great licence for the commission of injury, since the
goods of the rulers often cannot so easily be got at, as those of pri-
vate persons, who are more numerous. And therefore this is one of
the rights which, Justinian says, were instituted by nations on the
exigency of usage and to meet human necessitieS.

2 And this is not in any way so repugnant to nature that it may
not be introduced by usage and tacit consent, since sureties become
bound for debts without any cause, by consent alone. And it was to
be hoped that the members of the same society would be able to ex-
act rights from one another, and to consult their own indemnity more
easily than strangers, who in many cases are little attended to: and
moreover there was by such an obligation an advantage to be gained
by all peoples, so that they upon whom in one case it presses heavily,
in another would find their relies in it.
