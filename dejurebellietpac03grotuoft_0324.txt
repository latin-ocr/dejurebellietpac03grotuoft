torted by the sear of having the chastity of women violated, or by any
other terror contrary to good saith, it is more true that the matter
remains subject to Natural Law3 for the Law of Nations does not
extend its countenance to such sear.

XIII. 1 We have above said, that faith is to be kept even with
the perfidious3 and Ambrose teaehes the same. And this is undoubt-
edly to be extended also to perfidious enemies3 such as were the Oar-
thaginians, to whom the Romans religiously kept their faith- The
Senate look-ed to itself, not το those to whom the performance was made,
says Valerius Maximus, And Sallust says the like.

2 Appian says of the saith-breaking Lusitanians, whom Sergius
Galba deceived by a new convention, and so put to death, that he
avenyed pevfldy by pcrfidy, and, in a way contrary to thc Roman diynity,
imitated the barbariam. And on that ground, this Galba was after-
wards brought under accusation by Libo, the tribune of the people;
and then, as Valerius Maximus remarks, lee question was not deter-
mincd by justice but by mercy ,· and tho acquittal which could not be yiven
to his innocence‚ was gyranted out of reyard to his children. Cato, in his
Origines, had written, on this occurrence, that except he had had
reeourse to tears and children, he would have been condemned.
