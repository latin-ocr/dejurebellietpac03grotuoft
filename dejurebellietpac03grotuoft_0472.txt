THE BACCHAE OF EURIPIDES. With Introduction,

Critical Notes‚ and Archaeological Illustrations, by J. E. SANDvS‚

Litt.D. New and Enlarged Edition.

“ Osthe present edition ofthe Bacchae by Mr
Sandys we may safely say that never before has
a Greek play, in England at least, had fuller
justice done to its criticism, interpretation,
and archaeological illustration, whether for the
young student or the more advanced scholar.
The Cambridge Public Orator may be said to
have taken the lead in issuing a complete edi-
tion os a Greek play, which is destined perhaps
to gain redoubled favour now that the study os
ancient monuments has been applied to its il-
lustration.’'—Saturday Revz'ew.

Crown Svo. 125. 6d.

“ The volume is interspersed with well-
executed woodcuts, and its general attractive-
ness of form reflects great credit on the Uni-
versity Press. In the notes Mr Sandys has more
than sustained his well-earned reputation as a
careful and learned editor, and shows consider·
able advance in freedom and lightness of style.
. . . Under such circumstances it is superfluous
to say that sor the pnrposes of teachers and ad-
vanced students this handsome edition far sur-
passes all its predecessors.⁷'—A tlzenaenm.

INTRODUCTION TO GREEK EPIGRAPHY.
The Archaic Inscriptions and the Greek Alphabet by E. S.

ROBERTS, MA, Fellow and Tutor of Gonville and Caius College.

Demy Svo. With illustrations.

“We will say at once that Mr Roberts ap-
pears to have done his work very well. The
book is clearly and conveniently arranged.
The inscriptions are naturally divided accord-
ing to the places to which they belong. Under
each head are given illustrations sufficient to
show the characteristics of the wrsting, one
copy in letters of the original form (sometimes
a faesimile) being followed by another in the
usual cursive. References, which must have
eost great labour‚ are given to the scattered

notices bearing on each document. Explana-
tory remarks either accompany the text or are
added in an appendix. To the whole is pre-
fixed a sketch of the history of the alphabet up
to the terminal date. At the end the result is
resumed in general tables of all the alphabets‚
classified according to their connexions; and a
separate table illustrates the alphabet of Athens.
The volume contains about five hundred in-
scriptions, and forms a moderate octavo os about
four hundred pages.''—Saturday Review.
