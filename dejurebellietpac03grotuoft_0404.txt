394³ DE FIDE PRIVATA IN BELLO. [LIB. III.

recedendi, si id, quod per errorem creditum fuit, in mente
agentis vim habuerit conditionis.

V. 1 At, quo usque se extendat privatorum in pacis-
cendo potestas, difficilior inspectio est. Quod publicum est, a
privato alienari non posse satis constat: nam si ne ducibus
quidem belli id permissum est, ut modo probavimus, multo
minus privatis. Sed de ipsorum actionibus ac rebus quaeri
potest, quia videntur haec quoque concedi hostibus non posse
sine aliquo damno partis: unde videri possunt talia pacta
illicita cum civibus ob jus supereminens civitatis, tum conductis
militibus ob fidem sacramento datam.

2 Sed sciendum est, ea pacta, quae malum majus aut cer-
tius evitant, magis utilia quam damnosa etiam publico censeri
debere, quia minus malum induit rationem boni: χρὴ τῶν
κακῶν ἐπιλὲὙεσθαι τὰ μετριώτερα, ut ait quidam apud
Appianum. Neque vero fides sola, qua quis potestatem ipsam
sui et suarum rerum non abdicat, neque utilitas publica sine
legis auctoritate id efficere possunt, ut quod factum est, etiamsi
contra officium factum esse detur, irritum sit et effectu juris
omni careat.

dition.

V. 1 How far the power of private personS, to make agreements,
extends, is a more difficult question. That what is public property
cannot be alienated by a private person, is sufficiently plain: for if
that was not even permitted to generals, as we have proved just nOW,
much less is it to private persons. But it may be questioned concern-
ing their own actions and property3 because it may seem that these
also cannot be eonceded to the enemy without some damage of the
party: whence it may seem that such paets with the enemy are
unlawful for citizens, on account of the eminent jurisdiction of the
state3 and for regular soldiers, on account of their military oath.

2 But it is to be considered that those paets which are made in
order to avoid a greater 01· certain evil, ought to be reckoned more
useful than hurtful to the pubIIc also3 because the lesser evil assumes
the nature of a good. Nor does fidelity to the state or his superior3
since by this the person does not abdicate his power over himself and
his property3 nor does the public utility alone, without the authority
of law3 produce such an effect, that what is done, even if it be done
against duty, shall be void and destitute of jural effect.

3 Law indeed may take from subJeets, either perpetual or tem-
