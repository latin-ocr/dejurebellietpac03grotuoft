2 That the right of taking booty within the natural boundarics
which I have mentioned was approved by God, appears from other
places also. God, in his laW‚ speaking of a city taken after it had
refused peace, says, Deut. XX. 14: All the spoil thereos skalt thou take
to tlzsssseis} and thou slzalt eat the spoil of thino encmies which tlte
Lord thy God ham yiven theo. So 1 Chron. V. 20, the Reubenites,
Gaditas, and half tribe of Manasseh, made war upon the Hagarites
and their neighbours, and took much spoil; there being added as a
reason, that they cried to God in the battle and ho was entreated of
them. Also 2 Chron. xiv. 13, the pious king Asa is related to have
cried unto the Lord, and to have conquered the Ethiopians who
attacked him unjustly, and to have carried away very much spoil:
which is the more to be noted, because in that case arms were not
taken up by a special mandate, but on the ground of the common
Laws of N ations.

3 Also Joshua, (xxii. 8) when he sent away the Reubenites‚ and
blessed them, said, Divide the spoil ofyour cnemies with your brethren.
And David, (l Sam. xxx. 26) when he sent to the Hebrew elders
part of the spoil of the Amalekites‚ said, Beholol a present to you of
the spoil of tho enemies of the Lord. Indeed as Seneca sayS, it is a
graceful thing for a military man to enrich a friend with the spoil of
