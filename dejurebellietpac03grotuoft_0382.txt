372 DE FIDE MANENTE BELLO, [L1n.111.

IX. 1 Quaeritur, an qui vi majore impeditus quo minus
recederet, intra fines hosticos deprehenditur postquam exie-
rint induciae, jus redeundi habeat? Si jus externum gentium
respicimus, non dubito quin hic par sit ei, qui cum in pace
venisset bello repente exorto inter hostes fato suo deprehen-
ditur, quem captivum manere ad pacem usque supra notavi-
mus3 neque justitia interna deest, quatenus bona et actiones
hostium pro debito civitatis obligantur, et in solutum capiun-
tur: nec magis hic quod queratur habet, quam tot alii inno-
centes, in quos bellorum mala recidunt.

2 Nec quae de commissi causa circa merces tractantur
adferri huc debent, nec quod apud Ciceronem est De Inven-
tione secundo, de nave rostrata vi ventorum in portum delata,
quam ex lege quaestor publicari volebat. Ibi enim vis major
a poena liberat3 hic proprie de poena non agitur, sed de jure
quod certo tantum tempore interquieseebat. Tamen quin
talem remittere benignius, quin et generosius sit, nullam habet
dubitationem.

of Bclisarius against the Goths is refuted ; for he, on such a pretence
had seized in time of truce places stripped of their garrisons.

IX. 1 It is made a question, whether he who, being prevented by
maj0r force* from retreating, is caught within the boundaries of the
enemy after the period of the truce has expired‚ has the right of
returning. If we rcgard the external Law of Nations, I do not doubt
that such a person is in the position of one who, having come in peace,
is, by the sudden breaking out of war, caught by accident among ene-
mies3 and we have noticed before that such a one remains a prisoner
till a peace. Nor is internal justice wanting for such a proceeding3 so
far as the goods and actions of enemies are bound for the debt of the
state, and are taken towards its payment. Nor has such a person
more ground to complain, than so many other innocent persons upon
whom the calamities of war fall.

2 N or ought there to be urged, on the other side, the cases of mer-
chandises which, by stress of weather, are carried past the place where
dues are to be paid, and which nevertheless are excused†; nor the
case mentioned by Cicero, of a ship of war, forced by stress of weather
into a port, where its entering was contrary to the laW, and which the
questor wanted to confiscate. For in these cases, the operation of
