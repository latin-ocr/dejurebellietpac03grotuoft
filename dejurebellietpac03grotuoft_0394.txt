384 DE FIDE MINORUM POTESTATUM [Lm. 111.

II. Est autem in horum promissis duplex inspectio: nam
aut hoc quaeritur, an summam potestatem obligent, aut an se
ipsos. aPrior quaestio definienda estex eo, quod alibi diximus,
obligari nos et per eum quem voluntatis nostrae ministrum
elegerimus, sive voluntas illa specialiter expressa est, sive ex
ipsa praepositionis natura colligitur. Nam qui dat faculta-
tem, dat quantum in se est quae ad facultatem sunt necessaria,
quod in materia morali intelligendum est morali modo. Duo-
bus ergo modis potestates minores supremam suo facto obstrin-
gunt, faciendo id quod probabiliter ipsorum officio contineri
censetur, aut etiam extra illud ex speciali praepositione nota
publice, aut iis quorum res agitur.

III. Sunt et alii modo, quibus potestas summa obligatur
antecedente ministrorum facte, sed non ita, ut id factum causa
sit proprie dieta, sed ut occasio sit obligationis: idque dupli-
citer, vel per consensum, vel per rem ipsam. Consensus ap·
paret ratihabitione, non tantum expressa, sed et tacita, id est,
ubi scivit summa potestas quod actum erat, et fieri passa est,
quae ad aliam causam referri probabiliter non possunt3 quod

ΙΙ. The promises of Officers of this kind give rise to two kinds of
considerations: Whether they bind the supreme authority3 and
whether they bind themselves. The former question is to be decided
by what we have said; that we are bound by his acts whom we have
selected as the minister of our will, whether that will be specially
expressed, or be collected from the nature of the command committed
to him. For he who gives the means of acting, gives, as far as
depends on him, the means which arc necessary to such aetion: which,
in moral matters, is to be understood in a moral manner. Therefore
there are two ways in which subordinate authorities bind the
supreme authority by their acts: either by doing that which, on pro-
bable grounds is conceived to be included in their office ; or beyond
that, committed to them by some special assignment of authority,
known to those whose interests are dealt with.

III. There are also other ways in which the supreme authority
is bound, in virtue of an antecedent act of its ministers, but so that
that act is not, properly speaking, the cause of the obligation, but the
occasi0n3 and that, in two ways3 either by consent of the superior,
or by the thing itself. Consent appears by sanction of the aet3 not
express only, but tacit als03 that is, when the supreme authority knew
