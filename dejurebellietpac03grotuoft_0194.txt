]84‹ DE POSTLIMINIO. [LIB. III.

XVII. Potest tamen lege civili aliud constitui: sicuti
blege Hispanica naves a piratis captae eorum fiunt, qui eas
eripiunt piratis: neque enim iniquum est, ut privata res pub-
licae utilitati cedat, praesertim in tanta recuperandi difficultate.
Sed lex talis non obstabit exteris, quo minus res suas vin-
dicent.

XVIII. 1 Illud magis mirandum, quod testantur Ro-
manae leges, postliminii jus locum habuisse non tantum inter
hostem sed et inter Romanos et populos externos. Sed alibi
diximus, reliquias has esse saeculi Nomadum, quo sensum
naturalis societatis, quae est inter homines, mores exsut-dave-
rant. Itaque apud gentes etiam, quae bellum publicum non
gererent, erat quaedam belli inter privatos quasi ipsis moribus
indicti licentia: ac, ne ea licentia ad interficiendos homines
prosiliret, placuit captivitatis jura inter eos introduci, cui con-
sequens fuit, ut et postliminio locus esset, aliter quam cum
latronibus ac piratis, quia illa vis rem producebat ad aequas
pactiones, quae a latr-onibus et piratis contemni solent.

XVII. But other rules than this may be established by Civil
Law: as by the Spanish law, ships become theirs who regain them
from pirates3 nor it is not unreasonable that private interests should
yield to public-utility3 especially, the difficulty of recovery being so
great. But such a law does not prevent strangers from trying to
recover what is theirs.

XVIII. 1 It is more remarkable, that, as the Roman Laws testify,
the right of postliminium had place, not only between enemies‚ but
between the Romans and foreign nations. But, as we have elsewhere
said, these traits were relicks of the nomade age of mankind, in which
barbarous manners had blunted the natural sense of the natural
society which ought to bind men to men. And thus, even between
nations which had not a public war between them, there was a kind of
licence of private undeclared war: and in order that this licence might
not go to the length of putting strangers to death, there was intro-
duced a right of making prisoners between nations3 from which it
followed, that there was also occasion for postliminium, in a different
way than with robbers and pirates; because that force, used in such cases,

led to fair compacts3 which are commonly held in no regard by robbers
and pirates.
