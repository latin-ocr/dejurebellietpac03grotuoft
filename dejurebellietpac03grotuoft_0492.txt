1s. .

‘¹ Mr Sidgwick's editing of the Sixth Book os Ovid’s Fasti surnishes a careful and serviceable
volume sor average students. It eschews ‘construes ' which supersede the use of the dictionary,
but gives full explanation of grammatica! usages and historical and mythical allusions‚ besides
illustrating peculiarities os style, true and false derivafions, and the more remarkable variations of

the text.’'-Saturday Revzew.

QUINTUS CURTIUS. A Portion of the History.

of St John's College, Cambridge, and T. E. RAVEN‚ B.A.‚ Assistant Master
in Sherborne School. 35. 6d.

“Equally commendable as a genuine addition to the existing stock of school-books is
Alexander in India, a compilation from the eighth and ninth books os Q Curtius, edited sor
the Pitt Press by Messrs Heitland and Raven. . . . The work of Curtius has merits of its
own, which, in former generations, made it a favourite with English scholam, and which still
make it a popular text-book in Continental schoolS. . . . . . The reputation os Mr Heitland is a
sufficient guarantee sor the scholarship of the noteS, which are ample without being excessive,
and the book is well furnished with all that is needful in the nature os maps, indices, and

, appendices.”—Academy.

“ Mr Sidgwick’s Vergil is ...... we believe, the best school edition os the poet.’'—G¹mrdian.

‘¹ Mr Arthur Sidgwick's ‘ Vergil, Aeneid‚ Book XI1.' is worthy of his reputation, and is dis-
tinguished by the same acuteness and accuracy os knowledge, apprecmtion of a boy's difficulties
and ingenuity and resource in meeting them, which we have on other occasions had reason to
praise in these pages.''— lee Academy.

“As masterly in its clearly divided presace and appendices as in the sound and independent
character osits annotations. . . . There is a great deal more in the notes than mere compilation
and suggestion. No difficulty is lest unnoticed or unhandled.”—Saturday Review.
