2 At, cui abire datum, non et redire: sed nec, cui venire
concessum est, mittere poterit: nec contra: sunt enim haec
diversa, nec extra verba exspatiari ratio cogit: ita tamen ut
error etsi jus non det, a poena certe, si qua adjecta est, rele-
vet. Sed et cui venire permissum est, semel veniet, non ite-
rum, nisi temporis adjectio aliam suppeditet conjecturam.

deprecarw' peregrinari sine ea. Famulus tamen unus aut alter, etiamsi
expressus non sit, comprehensus censebitur in ee, quem sine

amase: tali comitatu ire indecorum foret: nam qui aliquid concedit,

ῗῗῗῖιῗῖἕῑῖἶ concedit quae necessario sequuntur: necessitas autem hic mo-

XVIII. Similiter bona non quaevis comprehendentur, sed

quae solita sunt ad iter assumi.

ture is understood to extend till the person comes to a place where
he is in safety. And hence, Alexander is accused of bad saith, who,
having granted safe departure to certain persons, ordered them to
be put to death on the way.

2 But he who is allowed to depart, is not, necessarily, allowed to
return: and he who is allowed to come himself, cannot send another:
nor on the contrary, cau he who is allowed to send, come himself.
For these are different things, nor does reason compel us in this ease
to wandel· beyond the words; but yet so that a mistake on this sub-
ject, though it do not give a right, yet relieves the person from the
penalty if any be added. Also he who is allowed to coine, is allowed
to come once, not repeatedly, except by the addition of time, ground
is given to conjecture otherwise.

XVII. The son is not allowed to accompany the father, nor the
wife the husband, any otherwise than is allowed in the right of
dwelling in the enemy's territory: for we are used to dwell with our
families, but to travel without them. But one or two servants, even
if it be not expressed, will be supposed to be comprehended in the
case of a person who cannot with decorum travel without such
accompaniment: for he who concedes any favour, concedes its ne-

cessary consequences: and necessity is here to be understood
morally.
